              Boost Tools
            
            
              Boost developers, testers, and maintainers have developed
              various programs to help with the administration of the Boost
              Libraries. Like everything else about Boost, these tools are
              available in source form, and are part of the regular Boost
              distribution.
              Users may find these tools useful when porting Boost
              libraries to a new platform, or for use with their own
              applications.
              
                Boost.Build
                The Boost build system, including the full Boost version
                of the jam sources.
                Regression
                The Boost regression testing system reporting
                sources.
                Inspect
                The inspection tool used to detect errors in the Boost
                directory hierarchy.
                BoostBook
                A Boost documentation system, based on DocBook and the Extensible Stylesheet Language
                (XSL), used by some Boost libraries.
                bcp
                A utility to extract subsets of Boost; to determine which
                parts of Boost your code is using; and to print reports on
                Boost usage (including Licence information).
                QuickBook
                QuickBook is a WikiWiki style documentation tool geared
                towards C++ documentation using simple rules and markup for
                simple formatting tasks. QuickBook generates BoostBook XML.
                Wave
                A Standards conformant C/C++ preprocessor usable on top
                of any other compiler. Usable for instance for the debugging
                of the expansion of macros in your code or as a replacement
                for your built-in preprocessor.
