              initiative, a program by which student developers are sponsored
              for their contributions within open source organizations
              willing to mentor the participants. The 2006 campaign has run
              between April and September, with active development work
              taking place between May 23 and August 21.</p>

              <p>Around mid April, when the program had just started, some
              Boost members began considering the possibility to enter Summer
              of Code as a mentoring organization. Despite the lack of time
              and the fact that most of us were completely new to this
              initiative, Boost managed to successfully apply for the
              program. As a result ten projects were selected and mentored,
              most of which are expected to become full contributions to
              Boost in the near future.</p>

              <p>We give here a summary report of this experience, along with
              a short analysis of the main problems we found, so that we can
              work at solving them and do better next year.</p>

              <h2><a name="how_the_program_works" id=
              "how_the_program_works"></a>How the program works</h2>

              <p>There are three types of participants in Google Summer of
              Code:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Google itself acts as the funding partner and conducts
                the overall program.</li>

                <li>The open source organizations accepted into the program
                must designate people inside the organization who will act as
                project mentors.</li>

                <li>Students submit their project ideas and, if selected,
                work in collaboration with one of the mentoring
                organizations; upon successful completion of the project,
                students receive the full stipend for the program.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The program goes through the following stages:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Organization selection: those open source organizations
                willing to enter Summer of Code submit an expression of
                interest to Google, along with information Google uses for
                qualifying purposes. Selected organizations are publicly
                announced and each organization is expected to provide a pool
                of project ideas.</li>

                <li>Student selection: students willing to participate submit
                one or more project proposals, typically expanding on some of
                the ideas previously provided by the mentoring organizations.
                A student can apply several times and for different
                organizations, but ultimately can only be chosen for just one
                project. These proposals are routed by Google to the
                appropriate organizations, which must analyze them, rank
                them, and assign mentors to the most promising applications.
                Based on the information provided by mentoring organizations,
                Google issues the final list of accepted projects.</li>

                <li>Development: Students, guided by their assigned mentors,
                are expected to complete the projects in a period of three
                months. Google asks mentors for a mid-program review upon
                which continuation of the project depends.</li>

                <li>Final review: Once the development period is over,
                mentors are requested to inform Google on the results of the
                project, and determine whether students qualify to receive
                the full stipend.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3><a name="figures_2006" id="figures_2006"></a>2006
              figures</h3>

              <p>The 2006 campaign of Google Summer of Code took place
              between April 14 and September 25. A total of 102 mentoring
              organizations participated. Of the 6,338 applications submitted
              by 3,044 students around the globe, 630 were finally selected
              and funded. Google has spent more than US$3 million in student
              stipends and compensations to the mentoring organizations.</p>

              <h2><a name="boost_participation" id=
              "boost_participation"></a>Boost participation</h2>

              <h3><a name="application_and_process_selection" id=
              "application_and_process_selection"></a>Application and process
              selection</h3>

              <p>On April 14, the same day Google Summer of Code started,
              Julio M. Merino Vidal (later to become one of the selected
              students) sent a message encouraging Boost members to
              participate in this program as a mentoring organization. This
              call sparked the interest of the community; although time was
              already short for doing all the preparation labors, Boost
              moderators put rapidly themselves to work and conducted the
              preliminary registration steps. In the meantime, a Wiki page
              was grown with project ideas provided by Boost members,
              totalling more than twenty proposals.</p>

              <p>By the beginning of May Boost was officially accepted into
              the program and Boost moderators set out to form a group of
              mentors, selected on an invitation basis. As student selection
              is a delicate process, involving the assessment of individuals
              on their technical skills, all subsequent discussions were
              conducted by the selected mentors on a private mail list
              established for their collaboration.</p>

              <p>We were not prepared for the avalanche of student
              applications that followed. On day two after the application
              period was open, we had received three proposals; next day it
              was 14, and within a week the count exceeded 50. By the end of
              the application period the total number of proposals received
              was 174, which forced us to go through a very intensive ranking
              process and recruit additional mentors. Two rules were followed
              so as rationalize the process of selection among dozens of
              different proposals:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Where there were competing applications for the same
                project idea, only one were to be ultimately selected; so, no
                two projects with the same or very similar goals were
                accepted.</li>

                <li>Some of the applications built on a given Boost library
                (for instance, the Boost Graph Library is a frequent target
                for the addition of algorithms.) We limited the applications
                to a maximum of two per Boost library.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>These rules have the combined effect of greatly reducing the
              number of eligible applications while at the same time
              distributing the accepted projects evenly across the space of
              ideas. Moreover, students with unique proposals, i.e. project
              ideas not coming from the pool originally presented by Boost,
              are at a competitive advantage.</p>

              <p>The different proposals were classified according to its
              related technological area so that each cluster could be
              handled by an appointed mentor with the required expertise on
              the subject. Mentors submitted then "focus reports" summarizing
              the applications under their responsibility; these reports
              served as a first filter to help reduce the number of final
              applications to be evaluated jointly. Along the process,
              students with the most promising proposals were asked to refine
              their ideas and provide further information.</p>

              <p>Although not enforced by the official rules, we agreed upon
              a one-to-one ratio of mentors to students, which ultimately
              marked a hard limit on the maximum number of eligible
              projects.</p>

              <h3><a name="accepted_projects" id=
              "accepted_projects"></a>Accepted projects</h3>

              <p>Google accepted and funded the ten top-ranked projects
              endorsed by Boost. Of these, eight projects are libraries or
              library components targeted for future inclusion into Boost,
              while the remaining two consist of utility programs heavily
              relying on Boost.</p>

              <h3><a name="development" id="development"></a>Development</h3>

              <p>Two main facilities were set up to assist students and
              mentors during the development phase: a mailing list and a
              Trac/SVN project management system with separate directories
              for each project. One of the students, Mat&iacute;as Capeletto,
              out of personal initiative registered a Google Group aimed at
              giving students with Boost a place for informal interaction and
              discussion of common problems.</p>

              <p>After the initial warm-up period, each student-mentor pair
              performed development work mostly privately. The usage of the
              Boost mailing lists was scarce, and only by the end of the
              program did some students publicly announced their results.</p>

              <p>By the date the development period was officially closed,
              the status of the different projects was as follows:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Seven projects were completed or nearly completed and the
                students are expected to ask for a formal review within 2006
                or early 2007. Four of these projects necessitated a goal
                reorientation during development, basically because the
                original plan was too ambitious for three months. Most of the
                projects are still in active development during the months
                following the Summer of Code program.</li>

                <li>Two projects did not reach the planned goals, but
                nevertheless produced useful material that could be expanded
                outside of the Summer of Code program.</li>

                <li>One project was abandoned shortly after the midterm
                review. The reasons for the abandonment are unknown.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The fact that Boost is ranked the sixth most attractive
              organization out of a total of 102 was entirely unexpected,
              especially considering the wide popularity of the rest of
              top-rated organizations. There is a more or less implicit
              consensus among Boost members that ours is a relatively niche
              project, known for its quality standards by seasoned C++
              practitioners, but with a limited penetration among entry level
              programmers: maybe the figures above should make us reconsider
              this assumption. A cursory examination of the applications
              submitted to Boost reveals that most applicants were regular
              users of Boost: many cite the Boost status among the C++
              community as an appealing factor in order to apply.</p>

              <p>It turns out that the project/application ratio for almost
              any other organization among the top nine is considerably
              higher than that of Boost. As it happens, Google initially
              requested that organizations submitted the maximum number of
              projects they felt they could cope with, and we got funding for
              exactly what we aimed for, so the limiting factor lies entirely
              on Boost's side.</p>

              <h3><a name="projects_startup" id=
              "projects_startup"></a>Projects startup</h3>

              <p>Contributing to Boost relies on a fair number of guidelines
              and protocols for coding, documentation, testing and
              maintenance. Many of the required tools are exclusively used
              within Boost, and some of them are not trivial, like for
              instance Boost.Build. Although the Boost web site contains
              information about all these tools and procedures, this
              intelligence is scattered through unrelated pages and sometimes
              is very hard to come by.</p>

              <p>So, there is a good deal of expertise required to begin
              working at Boost. Some students have reported on startup
              difficulties getting to know these details and familiarizing
              themselves with the tools, most notably <code>bjam</code> and
              Quickbook. Each student overcome the startup difficulties on
              their own or resorting to their mentors (see the section on
              <a href="#public_communication_issues">public communication
              issues</a>).</p>

              <h3><a name="ongoing_development" id=
              "ongoing_development"></a>Ongoing development</h3>

              <p>Once students got past the startup stage, most projects
              advanced without serious complications. In the majority of
              cases, it was realized at some point during the development
              that there was no time to complete it. Some participants had to
              redefine the goals in an effort to keep the project within
              schedule, while others simply decided that they would continue
              working after the official deadline of Summer of Code.</p>

              <p>The information flow between each student and their mentor
              was usually reported by both parties to be satisfactory. The
              projects suffering from lack of communication have been
              precisely those yielding the poorest results. In general,
              mentors have not felt overwhelmed by requests from their
              students, and even in a couple of cases the projects were run
              practically unattendedly. This fact is witness to the high
              competence of the students recruited into the program.</p>

              <p>The degree of usage of the Trac/SVN system has varied. Some
              students did frequent updates, while others have just used the
              repository to dump the final results for the official
              submission to Google.</p>

              <h3><a name="public_communication_issues" id=
              "public_communication_issues"></a>Public communication
              issues</h3>

              <p>Students and mentors had at their disposal three different
              forums for the public interchange of information and
              support:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Boost public lists, especially the developers and users
                lists.</li>

                <li>A dedicated mailing list reaching all students and
                mentors working at Summer of Code in Boost.</li>

                <li>A more casual Google Group, set up by one of the
                students, aimed at providing the participants with a place
                for socializing and resolution of common problems.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Despite this abundance of resources, there was an almost
              complete lack of group communication among all the parties
              involved and between these and the larger Boost community.
              Seemingly, students were satisfied to pursue their activities
              by relying on support from their mentors alone. This
              circumstance has prevented Boost members from enriching the
              initiative by offering their experience and insight, and has
              possibly led students to the false impression that contributing
              to Boost proceeds in a predictable linear path from requisites
              to completion of the work. When asked about their not engaging
              in public communication, the students gave vague justifications
              that can be classified into the following:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Doubts were deemed too technical or specific to be worth
                raising in public.</li>

                <li>A crave for perfectionism detracted students from asking
                or submitting work in progress until they felt their material
                looked good enough.</li>

                <li>Shyness: some students probably lacked previous
                experience communicating in public, and most are not English
                native speakers, which could also be a limiting factor.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Although students did not identify the following as a reason
              not to go public, it is likely that many of them did not feel
              the need given the readily access to their mentors they
              enjoyed. It is easy to grow used to such a dedicated source of
              support and neglect resorting to other resources. Mentors
              should have encouraged their students to pursue the public
              discussion of projects, which constitutes one of the pillars of
              Boost renowned quality.</p>

              <h3><a name="scope_of_projects" id=
              "scope_of_projects"></a>Scope of projects</h3>

              <p>In hindsight, it has become apparent that most projects were
              too ambitious to be completed within the three months of
              duration of the program, and even those that were considered a
              success will need weeks or months of polishing up before the
              material is ready for a formal review. In contrast with other
              organizations participating in the Summer of Code program,
              Boost has as of this writing included no results into its code
              base. No formal review for any project has been requested yet,
              either.</p>

              <p>These scope issues are very dependent on the particular type
              of project. We can classify the Boost projects for Summer of
              Code as follows:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Full-fledged libraries,</li>

                <li>additions to existing Boost libraries,</li>

                <li>utilities and tool projects using Boost.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Of these, additions (like for instance the mincut/maxflow
              algorithm for BGL by Stephan Diederich) are the most suitable
              for completion in a short period of time: most of the
              preparation work is already done, and the student has clear
              guides as to what coding and documentation standards to follow.
              Also, these projects need not undergo a formal review, since it
              is the responsibility of the hosting library author to review
              the code and include it within her discretion. Utility projects
              seem also suitable for small timeframes, though most project
              proposals and requests are naturally oriented to contributions
              of actual code to the Boost project.</p>

              <p>As for those projects involving the design and realization
              of full-fledged libraries, there is little hope that the goals
              and scope can be kept modest enough for a three-month schedule.
              Boost candidate libraries developed by professional authors
              usually take much longer than three months to be accepted; some
              libraries have been evolving through several <i>years</i>
              before being included into Boost. So, the best we can hope for
              if we are to support the realization of library projects for
              Boost inside Summer of Code is that the results by the end of
              the program can be evaluated to constitute a viable
              <i>potential</i> contribution to Boost. When this is the case,
              it is crucial that the student commits to further working on
              the project up to completion and formal review. Perhaps more
              important than getting libraries coded is to engage new authors
              into a long-term relationship with the Boost project.</p>

              <h2><a name="suggestions_for_improvement" id=
              "suggestions_for_improvement"></a>Suggestions for
              improvement</h2>

              <p>The following proposals aim to alleviate some of the
              problems we have identified during the development of Summer of
              Code within Boost. These action points are related only to the
              issues found in connection with Boost: we are not addressing
              other areas of improvement associated to the Summer of Code
              program itself.</p>

              <h3><a name="preparation" id="preparation"></a>Preparation</h3>

              <p>Much work can be done before the actual program begins. The
              following preparation activities can already be launched:</p>

              <p><strong>Create a pool of ideas for projects.</strong> This
              action will provide valuable extra time for evaluation and
              refining of ideas before the Summer of Code begins. The
              experience has shown that those projects with more preparation
              work, especially in the area of design, were ultimately more
              successful. The pool can also be used to retain interesting
              ideas that arise at the mailing lists and very often are not
              given proper attention and become abandoned.</p>

              <p><strong>Create a student pool.</strong> Prior involvement
              with Boost is clearly an advantage both in the selection phase
              and later during project development. Those students with a
              serious interest in participating in Summer of Code with Boost
              can enter the pool and begin exploring ideas and interacting
              with the community well in advance of the summer, so as to put
              themselves in a favorable position for the selection.
              Advertisement for the student pool can be initiated in the
              beginning of 2007 through the usual channels (web site and
              mailing lists): additionally, Boost members involved with the
              University can spread this information locally and help raise
              the interest of students in their environment.</p>

              <p><strong>Create a mentor pool.</strong> Given the rush with
              which Boost entered the 2006 Summer of Code campaign, the
              invitation of mentors has to be done on an on-demand basis as
              it became all too evident that the task was growing bigger and
              bigger. It is important that the organization is better
              prepared next year so that a number of people with the ability
              and will to participate as Boost mentors are identified in
              advance.</p>

              <p><strong>Prepare a startup package.</strong> In order to
              facilitate the initial period of getting familiarized with the
              various Boost guidelines, protocols and tools, it would be
              extremely useful to prepare a compilation of startup material
              for students. This package can consist of a single document
              gathering the currently dispersed information, or go beyond
              this and provide some bundle of documentation and pre-built
              tools, an approach that one of the students is currently
              working on.</p>

              <h3><a name="public_communication" id=
              "public_communication"></a>Public communication</h3>

              <p>It is crucial that students get involved with the community
              as soon as possible and grow to appreciate the advantages of
              public development with respect to solitary coding.</p>

              <p><strong>Mandate (bi)weekly reports.</strong> These reports
              should be directed to the public mailing lists so as to give
              all Boost members an opportunity to follow the work in progress
              and contribute. Reporting has the extra benefit for students of
              forcing them to reflect on their own work periodically and
              struggle with the often difficult task of presenting their
              ideas to others.</p>

              <p><strong>Conduct student-mentor exclusively through public
              channels.</strong> This might be too drastic a policy, as some
              matters need privacy, and depending on the amount of
              information exchanged flooding problems may arise. Less severe
              variations involve allowing for some private interchange at the
              mentors' discretion and moving this kind of communication to a
              dedicated public mailing list different from the general
              ones.</p>

              <h3><a name="project_management" id=
              "project_management"></a>Project management</h3>

              <p>The two most important issues to improve upon with respect
              to the management are:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Project scope must be kept under control,</li>

                <li>The progress has to be publicly visible, so that problems
                of scope, design and/or schedule can be more easily
                detected.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Some of the proposals in this section are not to be regarded
              as strict rules, but rather as general guidelines to be kept in
              mind by students and encouraged by mentors.</p>

              <p><strong>Create a best practices document.</strong> This
              document can serve as a guideline for project management, an
              area in which Boost traditionally imposes no requirements.
              Students might lack the expertise in this area that is usually
              taken for granted in the traditional model where contributions
              to Boost are made by professional programmers.</p>

              <p><strong>Mandate a design phase.</strong> Having a concrete
              design set up and clearly described early in the project will
              help estimate the necessary effort for completion of the work.
              This is also an opportunity for public discussion.</p>

              <p><strong>Maintain code, docs and tests in parallel.</strong>
              All too often, novice programmers do the coding in one fell
              swoop and only then move to testing and documenting their work.
              This is unacceptable by all current methodology standards, and
              can result in serious underestimations of the time to
              completion.</p>

              <p><strong>Encourage the KISS principle.</strong> It is much
              better to finish a simpler library and then iteratively evolve
              it, once it has been exposed to public scrutiny and usage.</p>

              <p><strong>More Trac updates.</strong> The repository should be
              viewed as an everyday work tool, not only as the place into
              which to dump the final results. Updating often leads to more
              visibility of the work by the mentor and the public in
              general.</p>

              <p><strong>Informal reviews.</strong> The typical Summer of
              Code Boost project will not be completed by the official
              deadline, as have been discussed earlier. To somehow
              officialize the work done within the Summer of Code proper, and
              also to allow the students to reach some sort of psychological
              milestone, informal reviews can be instituted where Boost
              members evaluate the work done at then end of Summer of
              Code.</p>

              <p><strong>Engage students.</strong> This experience has shown
              that it is possible to guide willing and bright students to the
              competence levels required for contributing to Boost. The best
              possible outcome of Summer of Code campaigns are the
              incorporation of new people into the circle of Boost active
              contributors. Strive to make the students commit to Boost.</p>

              <h2><a name="conclusions" id="conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2>

              <p>Despite the lack of previous experience in Boost, our
              participation in Google Summer of Code has been extremely
              fruitful: much useful material has been produced, and, perhaps
              more importantly, some of the students are likely to commit on
              a long-term basis and grow to be regular Boost contributors.
              Traditionally, becoming a productive Boost author has a very
              high entry barrier due to the extreme quality standards, lack
              of public support and the very specific culture of the project.
              The appeal of Summer of Code itself and the possibility of
              being gently mentored into the world of Boost have most likely
              been key factors in lowering this entry barrier.</p>

              <p>The process has not been without some difficulties, either,
              as it was expected of a newcomer organization as Boost. We have
              tried to identify in this paper the areas of improvement and
              suggest specific actions so that the upcoming Google Summer of
              Code 2007 can be an even more rewarding experience.</p>
