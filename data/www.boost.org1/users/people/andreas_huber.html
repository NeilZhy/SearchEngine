              Andreas Huber is currently on a parental leave. At former
              companies Andreas has been developing systems ranging from PC
              control software for machinery to custom-made CRM applications.
              In recent years, more and more of his professional work has
              shifted to the .NET platform (C# and C++/CLI).
              In his spare time Andreas still enjoys to program in
              standard C++, which is how Boost.Statechart
              came into being. His other hobbies include swimming, camping,
              hiking and traveling.
              Andreas lives in Zurich, Switzerland with his wife Ruth and
              son Marius.
