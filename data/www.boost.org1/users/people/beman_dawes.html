               Beman
              Dawes is a software developer from Virginia in the United
              States and the founder of boost.org.
              He is the author of the StreetQuick geographic atlas
              library used by digital map publishers to help people get
              really, really, lost.
              He wrote his first computer program 50 years ago, and does
              not mourn the passing of bi-quinary arithmetic.
              Beman has been a voting member of the ISO C++ Standards
              Committee since 1992, and chaired the Library Working Group for
              five years.
              He enjoys travel, sailing, hiking, and biking. He is
              married, and he and his wife Sonda have three cats.
