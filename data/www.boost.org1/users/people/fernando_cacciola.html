              Fernando Cacciola has been programming since
              1984 when he got his hand on a Tandy Color Computer II for the
              first time. He started with BASIC at the time, but quickly
              moved to Assembly Language to get the most out of the Home
              Computers of the time (from a Sinclair 1500 [Z80] to a
              Commodore 64 [Motorola 6510]).
              In 1990 he discovered the C programming language and started
              to work as a professional programmer. In 1995 he discovered
              C++, and during his long time employement in a company
              producing CAD systems, the fields of Geometric Computing,
              Computer Graphics, Image Processing and Numerics in
              general.
              He studied Biochemistry at the John F. Kennedy (Argentina)
              University for 4+ years, but had to drop because of his
              full-time job as a programmer. He would complete a CS degree if
              he only had the time.
              After 13 years of being an employed programmer (in just a
              couple of companies), by the end of 2003, he became a
              freelancer and founded SciSoft, a company specialized in
              technically/scientifically-oriented software.
              Currently he is an active developer of the Computational Geometry
              Algotithms Library (CGAL) and a member of the IEEE Computer
              Society, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and
              the ACCU
              community.
