              Ren has spent most of his life programming in one
              language or another. From assembly, through BASIC, and up to
              C++ and Lisp, he has managed to program on a variety of
              computers and operating systems.
              Currently he is running Redshift Software, Inc. (redshift-software.com), a company he founded
              with the help of some friends in 1997.
              In the past he managed to get a concurrent MS and BS in
              Computer Science from Loyola University at Chicago. Work for
              the Institute for the Learning Sciences at Northwestern
              University building AI related systems. And worked on game
              development at Jellyvision Inc. (jellyvision.com).
              Where he lead the programming of "You Don't Know Jack: The 5th
              Dementia", and of "That's a Fact: Jack! Read.". Which where the
              basis for the development of the first two versions of "Who
              Wants To Be a Millionaire".
              His motto of "clean code, clean graphics, it can always
              stand improvement" has repeatedly gotten him in trouble.
