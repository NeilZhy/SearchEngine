               Paul
              Moore lives in Cheshire, England. He is married, with one son.
              His "day job" is as an Oracle DBA, but he writes C and C++
              programs in his spare time.
              Paul started programming on Acorn's BBC Micro and RISC PC
              series of computers, but finally went mainstream and bought a
              PC, on which he now runs Windows and Linux. Paul's main
              interest is in porting and developing open-source software, and
              so his main programming language is C (at least until the open
              source community switches to C++).
              Paul's main claim to C++ fame is that he owns all 3 editions
              of Bjarne Stroustrup's "The C++ Programming language", plus the
              ARM and the C++ standard, but he didn't own a C++ compiler
              until after the 3rd edition of Stroustrup's book came out. Make
              of that what you will...
