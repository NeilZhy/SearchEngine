              Adler has been programming computers since 1976. He loves to do
              it.
              His first major professional experience was at Apple Computer. In 1988
              he led the team that rewrote the Macintosh Finder in C++.
              Before that project was completed, he was shanghaied to be the
              technical lead for the System 7 project (these days they would
              call it "Mac OS 7"). The group he formed to help him do that,
              the Blue Meanies, is still a legend in the Apple community.
              Since Apple, Darin has worked at General
              Magic as an architect of the Magic Cap OS, used the moniker Bent Spoon Software
              to do consulting, and helped start Eazel, a company that worked
              to make Linux easier to use and developed the Nautilus
              graphical shell for GNOME. Since 1997, he has worked from his home
              in Los Angeles, CA, collaborating with clients and coworkers in
              other locations.
              He prefers to use and program Macintosh computers with C++.
              But work on the GNOME project is best accomplished with a
              non-Macintosh PC. (That's why Darin is sitting in front of two
              computers.) The other people working on the GNOME project don't
              like C++, so he's writing a lot of C code these days.
              The picture shows him hard at work with his C++ guru, his
              daughter Sophia.
              He has hobbies and stuff but you don't want to read about
              that here.
