               If
              we are to believe MBTI tests, Vesa is an INTJ.
              He has been like that probably since late 1978-1979, because,
              according to some sources, it takes 2-3 years to develop the
              basic temperament. Previously he saw himself mostly as a
              "builder of systems" and "applier of theoretical models", but
              nowadays he is beginning to see the "mastermind" aspect of his
              personality. As a "Free-Thinker", his mind hardly ever
              rests.
              Vesa enjoys healthy and sustainable ways of life. He is a
              vegetarian and likes cooking. Exercise is a daily part of his
              life - he needs to be in good shape in order to sit all day in
              work. He likes going to the gym, swimming, spinning, running,
              roller skating, etc... He also practices dancing.
              For the past years, he has been working in a small company that
              develops console games. His role is the development of software
              technology, such as class libraries, frameworks and tools, for
              making games. He doesn't see himself as a game or a graphics
              programmer, although he has been involved in quite a few such
              projects. For the past few years, most of his programming has
              been in C++, but recently he has also enjoyed writing some
              Ocaml.
              He likes buying technical books using the company credit
              card, but lately he hasn't had the time to read as much as he
              would like (hopefully this changes soon). He likes reading (a
              lot) computer science and software engineering, but also
              psychology, philosophy and various self-help books, because he
              knows that all the really hard problems are social - not
              technical. Fantasy is also close to his heart.
              Vesa is a bit ambivalent about his university studies. He is
              a self-educated programmer and has experience ranging from bit
              twiddling to generative programming and also leading of small
              teams. Like many of his close colleagues, he sees that the
              depth of computer science education, at least in Finland, is,
              frankly, insufficient. He'll probably complete his studies some
              day, because sadly most people respect authority by rank, title
              or publication far more than he does.
              Vesa is an eXtreme Programmer. He has found out that in
              order for pair programming to work, both pairs must share a
              similar level of experience and must be both willing and able
              to externalize their thoughts. If he is sometimes forced to
              stop refactoring, he'll probably quit his job. He thinks that
              optimization, including improving readability and simplifying
              structure, is the root of all fun in programming. He dislikes
              writing documentation and reports that are never read.
              One of his friends coerced him to use the image that you see
              on this page. The image was scanned from a rather worn out
              picture taken by an ex-girlfriend and is probably the only
              picture of Vesa having his natural smile. Vesa is neither
              married nor engaged, but just recently he met a very nice
              girl... While programming is interesting and fun, it is love
              that really makes him happy. ;)
