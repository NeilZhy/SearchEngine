              Open Source Boost
            
            
              Boost is used in a variety of Open Source Projects, both
              applications and libraries. Indeed many Open Source libraries
              developed around Boost have in the past been judged of high
              enough quality to be absorbed into the main Boost source tree,
              a process that will no doubt continue into the future. Others
              are in highly specialized niche markets, ranging from
              probability theory to astronomy, via mass spectroscopy:
              whatever your field of interest you'll find something of value
              in Boost.
              Algocoders
               Algocoders
              has been using boost since last 6+ years with a mission to help people
              build a better software eco-system by standing on the shoulder of giants.
              
              
               
                If it wasn't for Boost, then it could have been really difficult for us
                to build our framework based on sound mathematical foundation of computer science
                using modern C++.
                It is the pioneering efforts at Boost towards
                "Using and Extending C++11, Boost and Beyond"
                which has motivated us to devote ourself in developing bullet-size capsules
                in the form of tiny booklets with industrial-set framework to lift the thin veil
                with initial focus on practical usage of C++11
                vis-a-vis mathematical foundation behind it.
               
               
                 Enthused by boost, we are working tirelessly towards publishing a series of
                 books (or booklets)
                 which will bridge the gap between esoteric and street-side ones.
                 Initial focus will be on C++11, Boost, Loki, STL, Algorithms, Data Structures,
                  Multi-threading, Design Patterns, gcc, Clang, valgrind.
               
               
                 First book in this series is Foundation of Algorithms in C++11, Volume 1:
                 Using and Extending C++11, Boost and Beyond (published December 2012)

                 We use almost all the libraries in Boost including trunk and branches,
                 especially Spirit, Phoenix, Proto, MPL, Fusion.
                
              Adobe Software Libraries
              The Adobe Software Libraries
              provide components for modeling the human interface appearance
              and behavior in a software application. The Adobe Software
              Libraries depend on many parts of Boost including Boost.Any,
              Boost.Bind,
              Boost.Function,
              Boost.MPL,
              Boost.Operators,
              Boost.Range,
              Boost.StaticAssert,
              Boost.Thread,
              and Boost.TypeTraits.
              Currently Boost and the Adobe Software Libraries are in use
              in around 30 Adobe products.
              LyX Document Editor
              The LyX
              Document Editor is an advanced open source document
              processor that encourages an approach to writing based on the
              structure of your documents, not their appearance. LyX produces
              high quality, professional output, using LaTeX, an industrial
              strength typesetting engine.
              LyX uses many parts of Boost, including Array, Boost.Bind,
              Boost.Regex,
              Boost.TypeTraits,
              Boost.Function,
              and Boost.Signals.
              CodeSynthesis XML Schema to C++ Data Binding Compiler (XSD)
              by Code Synthesis Tools CC
              CodeSynthesis XML
              Schema to C++ Data Binding Compiler (XSD) is an
              open-source, cross-platform XML Data Binding implementation for
              C++. Provided with an XML instance specification (XML Schema),
              it generates C++ classes that represent the given vocabulary as
              well as parsing and serialization code. You can then access the
              data stored in XML using types and functions that semantically
              correspond to your application domain rather than dealing with
              elements, attributes, and text in a direct representation of
              XML such as DOM or SAX.
              XSD uses Boost.Regex and
              Boost.FileSystem
              libraries from Boost. Boost.Regex is
              used to perform transformations on file, type and member names.
              Boost.FileSystem
              is used to capture and manipulate XML Schema include and import
              paths. Additionally, we are planning to provide an optional
              mapping of XML Schema date and time types to C++ types from the
              Boost Boost.DateTime
              library.
              CodeShop
              I am happy to announce Amsterdam based CodeShop has been using
              Boost since 2005 on all of it's projects (and CodeShop memebers
              have been using Boost since 2001).
              We used it on the following:
              OpenZoep
              An open source voip stack
              (xmpp-siprtp(port)audio/codecs), capable of pc2pc
              calls and pc2pstn calls - it's a message based sdk, so you
              could write your own Gtalk or Skype ...
              Boost is used everywhere: from the xmpp implementation
              (Boost.Function,
              Boost.Asio) to
              the codecs-wrapper (Boost.SmartPointers)
              - and more. Boost made the code a lot easier, more fun, safer
              and faster to develop. Bjam was used as build system.
              See description
              and trac&svn.
              Abonja / Whitelabelvideo
              Online videosharing platform: you can upload and watch
              flashvideo online, but at the same time run your pc client and
              download all your preferences automatically for viewing later
              at home
              Boost and C++ are used for the serverside tooling. Bjam is
              used as build system.
              www.abonja.nl and www.whitelabelvideo.nl
              (Dutch only: a javascript sdk for viewing and uploading - Boost
              is used serverside also).
              Code from above and other projects made available as plain
              download or as library.
              Pieces address 'simple' problems like a windows registry
              wrapper to more system like parts as for instance a drm
              implementation. Boost is used all over (__filesystem, Boost.Thread,
              Boost.Asio,
              Boost.Spirit
              etc); Boost.Build
              is used as build system.

              kept code clean. Format is being used for all text formatting.
              Having Boost.Thread
              and Boost.FileSystem
              libraries available made cross-platform development lot easier
              in those areas."
              Hugin
              With hugin you can assemble a
              mosiac of photographs into a complete immersive panorama,
              stitch any series of overlapping pictures and much more.
              Enblend
              Enblend is a tool for
              compositing images. Given a set of images that overlap in some
              irregular way, Enblend overlays them in such a way that the
              seam between the images is invisible, or at least very
              difficult to see.
              GNU Source-highlight
              
              GNU Source-highlight, given a source file, produces a
              document with syntax highlighting. The colors and the styles
              can be specified (bold, italics, underline) by means of a
              configuration file, and some other options can be specified at
              the command line. The output format can be HTML, XHTML and ANSI
              color escape sequences. GNU Source Highlight is build around
              Boost.Regex
              Luabind
              Luabind is a library that
              helps you create bindings between C++ and lua. It has the
              ability to expose functions and classes, written in C++, to
              lua. It will also supply the functionality to define classes in
              lua and let them derive from other lua classes or C++ classes.
              Lua classes can override virtual functions from their C++
              baseclasses. It is written towards lua 5.0, and does not work
              with lua 4.
              C++/Tcl

              "CBCAnalyzer (CBC = compensatory base change) is a tool
              to create small'' phylogenetic trees from sequence alignments.
              To measure the distance of sequences the compensatory base
              changes are detected and counted. The bionj algorithm is then
              used to construct a tree. CBCAnalyzer is available on Windows,
              Linux and partly works on MacOSX.
              "Boost libraries used: Boost.ProgramOptions
              - creates really nice output, and is both easy to extend and
              simple to handle. Boost.Iterator,
              Boost.Spirit -

              Profdist
              is developed by the Department of Bioinformatics, at the
              University of Wuerzburg.
              "Profdist is a tool for the construction of large
              phylogenetic trees based on profile distances. The input
              alignment data gets extended by random picking of rows, and a
              clustering technique is used to create profiles of the most
              frequent subtrees. The iterative approach allows working on
              large datasets. Currently the application is very limited by
              the quality of wxWidgets, and only available for Windows and
              Linux.
              "The Boost libraries used were: Boost.StringAlgorithms,
              Boost.Ref,
              Boost.Iterator,
              Boost.Spirit,
