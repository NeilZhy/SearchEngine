              In House Boost
            
            
              Whether you're a government department, an internet startup,
              or a specialist consultancy, in-house developement using the
              Boost Libraries can significantly shorten your development
              cycles.
              
              
              Cern
              The Large Hadron Collider
              experiments at CERN make use of the Boost C++ libraries.
              The experiment's C++ programs have several millions of
              lines of code for the detector simulation, data reconstruction and
              data analysis and use several of the components of the Boost library.
              Examples of Boost libraries used are Any, Spirit, Date Time, Program Options, Regex, SmartPtr, Thread.
              Google
              google-gtags
              Provides server-based tags serving for large codebases. This is
              an extension to GNU Emacs and X-Emacs TAGS functionality, that
              uses Boost.Test as
              its unit test framework.
              LiquidNet
              LiquidNet is Americas number
              one electronic marketplace for large block trading, and the 5th
              fastest growing company according to Inc Magazine.
              "Boost Libraries most used, in order of
              importance:
              Boost.SharedPointer,
              Boost.Bind,
              Boost.Python,
              Boost.LexicalCast,
              Boost.Optional,
              Boost.Any
              and Boost.Tuple"
              Oc-Technologies B.V.
              Throughout the world Oc is one of the major
              suppliers of document management and printing systems and the
              related services. We develop, manufacture, service and sell
              printers, scanners, peripheral equipment and media, supported
              by unique software. Oc products for the corporate and
              commercial market are widely known for their quality, ease of
              use, speed and reliability.
              The Boost libraries enable us to get a higher degree of
              uniformity and quality in our code. During a redesign last year
              we found that lots of small constructions from Boost shortens
              development time and prevents having to reinvent many wheels.
              Libraries that we use include Boost.Assign,
              Boost.DateTime,
              Boost.EnableIf,

              "We do a substantial amount of internal research to
              develop new approaches for applying machine-learning techniques
              to solve chemical problems. Because we're a small organization
              and chemistry is a large and complex field, it is essential
              that we be able to quickly and easily prototype and test new
              algorithms. We have found the Boost libraries, a reliable
              source of high-quality code, to be indispensable.

              "EB" Automotive
              "EB"
              Automotive is currently using Boost.GIL,
              Boost.MPL
              and Boost.StringAlgorithms
              for a in house tool. Additionally we use Stefan Seefelds
              Boost.XML from sandbox, with a few small extensions.
              "Especially Boost.GIL
              gave our image preprocessing routines a strong speed boost and
              greatly simplified our code".
