              Shrink Wrapped Boost
            
            
              Boost has found it's way into many products that are
              available "off the shelf", including consumer applications from
              Adobe, through to business middleware from SAP.
              Adobe Photoshop CS2
              Adobe
              Photoshop CS2 uses the Adobe Software Libraries,
              which in turn depend upon large parts of Boost. The Adobe Software
              Libraries are being rolled out across the Adobe product
              line to provide cross platform user interface logic.
              Adobe Indesign
              Adobe
              Indesign offers best of breed page design: Indesign and
              it's asociated SDK depend upon Boost Boost.Regex,
              Boost.Functional
              and others.
              SAP NetWeaver
              SAP
              NetWeaver is the technical foundation of mySAP Business
              Suite solutions, SAP xApps composite applications, partner
              solutions, and customer custom-built applications. Boost.Regex
              provides the regular expression implementation for SAP's
              ABAP
              language.
              Real Networks, Rhapsody
              The Rhapsody
              Music Service allows its subscribers to legally
              download/transfer/burn over a million songs. The Rhapsody
              client software was built with many Boost libraries:
              Boost.Format:
              Boost.Format is top notch. Using it is a bliss.
              Boost.Functional,
              Boost.Function,
              and Boost.Bind:
              These three libraries, along with Boost.SmartPointers
              are the most used in our application. I could not imagine not
              having them handy.
              Boost.SmartPointers:
              Hands down, the most useful, and used library of the lot!
              Boost.DateTime:
              Simple to use, effective, does the job. I love the flexible
              input string parsing facilities, and the human readable ISO
              output.
              Boost.Iterator:
              Wow. Moving legacy iterating interfaces, or interfaces that
              should of been properly designed as iterators to STL compliant
              iterators was easy and painless. The gains in functionality to
              our code made by this library are invaluable.
              Boost.Regex:
              When you need it, it works magic.
              Boost.Thread:
              Used to implement the monitor pattern in key areas.
              Boost.Preprocessor:
              Used to implement repetitive unit-test code generation. The
              codebase benefited greatly from the clarity Boost.Preprocessor
              brought.

                    Quick File Rename
                 is a unicode batch file and
                 folder renamer which allows photo collectors and audiophiles to rename
                 thousands of files and folders in seconds.  Users can tag audio files,
                 extract meta data information for photos, and perform other batch rename
                 operations to allow better categorisation of files and folders in Windows
                 Explorer.  Complex rename operations can be combined into a single step
                 using a rules system.  A command line mode is also supported.
                 Parts of boost used: All regular expressions used in Quick File Rename are
                 parsed by
                 Boost.Regex.  
                 This provided us with tremendous power for the text
                 manipulation that is used frequently in both in the GUI and console modes.

              and Boost.Bind:
              Provide a great flexibility compared to the STL. Boost.Timer: A
              very straightforward and effective timer.

              Dr. Detlef Meyer-Eltz, TextTransformer
              The TextTransformer is a
              Windows IDE for the generation of top down parsers with
              included c++ interpreter code for semantic actions. Both can be
              executed or debugged immediately on single source files or on
              groups of files. Generated parsers can be exported as c++ code
              including as well the interpretable code as any arbitrary other
              code. Tokens are defined as POSIX regular expressions and rules
              are defined in a similar syntax quasi as regular expressions of
              regular expressions. The construction of parse trees and their
              traversal is supported.
              "The TextTransformer is essentially based on the
              Boost.Regex,
              by which the tokens for a parser can be defined. The Boost.LexicalCast
              and the Format library are used for the integrated c++
              interpreter. For the future also an interpreter version of the
              Boost.StringAlgorithms
              is planned. The Boost.ProgramOptions
              library will be used too to improve the command line version of
              the texttransformer."
              Redshift Software, The Thot Tool
              The Thot
              Tool is an asset management tool for a group of game
              developers. Thot combines assets, both binary and text, with
              workflow automation into a unified whole, and was built using
              Boost Boost.Thread,
              Boost.SmartPointers,
              Boost.Regex,
              Boost.MPL, and
              Boost.TypeTraits.
              Paragent, Paragent Manage 2.1
              Paragent
              Manage is a Desktop Management Application that uses a
              lightweight agent written in C++. Unlike traditional desktop
              management solutions, Paragent Manage avoids the complexity and
              cost of servers by using peer-to-peer communication between
              agents and the administrative console. This allows real-time
              inventory searching, alerting and software auditing in an
              easy-to-deploy and maintain package.
              "We have used Boost extensively throughout our agent,
              including: Boost.Thread,
              Boost.SharedPointer,
              Boost.Bind,
              Boost.Spirit,
              Boost.DateTime,
              Boost.StringAlgorithms,
              Boost.MultiIndex,
              Boost.FileSystem.
              "Apart from some read_write_mutex issues we had, Boost
              has been a seamless part of our development, and has allowed us
              to develop and deploy a very complex, highly threaded
              networking agent with a built-in lisp-like xml-based scripting
              language all done in C++. Our entire development team would
              like to thank everyone for their hard work on behalf of C++
              coders everywhere."
