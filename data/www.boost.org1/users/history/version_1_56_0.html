    Modularization
    
      Boost version control has migrated to a system using git submodules. This shouldn't
      make too much of a difference to users, although the directory structure is
      now a bit different.
    
    
      Parts of some libraries have been moved into different modules, and several
      new modules have been extracted from existing code. All header paths should
      remain the same. The new modules are:
    
    
      
        
          Assert:
  Customizable assert macros.
          Maintained by Peter Dimov.
        
      
      
        
          Core:
  Core utilities used by other
          libraries, with minimal dependencies. Maintained by Peter Dimov, Glen Fernandes
          and Andrey Semashev.
        
      
      
        
          Lexical_Cast:
  General literal
          text conversions, such as an int represented a string, or vice-versa, from
          Kevlin Henney.
        
      
      
        
          Throw_Exception:
  A common
          infrastructure for throwing exceptions from Boost libraries, from Emil
          Dotchevski.
        
      
      
        
          Winapi:
  Windows API declarations without <windows.h>, for internal
          Boost use.
        
      
    
  
  
    New Libraries
    
      
        
          Align:
  Memory alignment functions,
          allocators, and adaptors, from Glen Fernandes.
        
      
      
        
          Type_Index:
  Runtime/Compile
          time copyable type info, from Antony Polukhin.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Acumulators:
          
            
              
                New accumulators rolling_variance
                and rolling_moment
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Any:
          
            
              
                Fixed rvalue references related issues (#9215, #9462).
              
            
            
              
                Dropped support of antique compilers.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Fixed asio::spawn()
                to work correctly with new Boost.Coroutine interface (#9442,
                #9928).
              
            
            
              
                Ensured that incomplete asio::spawn() coroutines are correctly unwound
                when cleaned up by the io_service
                destructor (#9731).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed delegation of continuation hook for handlers produced by io_service::wrap()
                and strand::wrap()
                (#9741).
              
            
            
              
                Changed the Windows I/O completion port backend to use ConnectEx, if available, for connection-oriented
                IP sockets.
              
            
            
              
                Changed the io_service
                backend for non-Windows (and non-IOCP Windows) platforms to use a
                single condition variable per io_service
                instance. This addresses a potential race condition when run_one()
                is used from multiple threads.
              
            
            
              
                Prevented integer overflow when computing timeouts based on some
                boost::chrono and std::chrono
                clocks (#9662, #9778).
              
            
            
              
                Made further changes to EV_CLEAR
                handling in the kqueue backend, to address other cases where the
                close()
                system call may hang on Mac OS X.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed infinite recursion in implementation of resolver_query_base::flags::operator~ (#9548).
              
            
            
              
                Made the select reactor
                more efficient on Windows for large numbers of sockets (#9528).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a Windows-specific type-aliasing issue reported by gcc
                (#9550).
              
            
            
              
                Prevented execution of compile-time-only buffer test to avoid triggering
                an address sanitiser warning (#8295).
              
            
            
              
                Disabled the GetQueuedCompletionStatus
                timeout workaround on recent versions of Windows.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for string-based scope IDs when using link-local multicast
                addresses.
              
            
            
              
                Changed IPv6 multicast group join to use the address's scope ID as
                the interface, if an interface is not explicitly specified.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed multicast test failure on Mac OS X and the BSDs by using a
                link-local multicast address.
              
            
            
              
                Worked around a gcc problem to do with anonymous
                enums (#10042).
              
            
            
              
                Reverted the Windows HANDLE
                backend change to ignore ERROR_MORE_DATA.
                Instead, the error will be propagated as with any other (i.e. in
                an error_code or
                thrown as a system_error),
                and the number of bytes transferred will be returned. For code that
                needs to handle partial messages, the error_code
                overload should be used (#10034).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed an off-by-one error in the signal_set
                implementation's signal number check (#9324).
              
            
            
              
                Changed to use SSE2 intrinsics rather than inline assembly, to allow
                the Cray compiler to work.
              
            
            
              
                Stopped using certain Winsock functions that are marked as deprecated
                in the latest Visual C++ and Windows SDK.
              
            
            
              
                Added a workaround for building the unit tests with gcc
                on AIX.
              
            
            
              
                Various minor documentation improvements (#8295, #9605, #9771).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Assign:
          
            
              
                Resolve some C++11 ambiguities (#3073).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Atomic:
          
            
              
                The library has been redesigned. Besides internal refactoring, various
                bugs were fixed, including incorrect values of feature test macros
                and integer overflow handling.
              
            
            
              
                Changed values of the memory_order
                enumeration. The concrete values are not part of the interface, but
                this change may potentially break ABI, if the enum is used in user's
                interfaces.
              
            
            
              
                Implemented support for 128-bit atomic operations on Windows x64
                with MSVC. The library assumes presence of the cmpxchg16b
                instruction in the target CPUs. Some early AMD CPUs don't support
                this instruction. To target those define the BOOST_ATOMIC_NO_CMPXCHG16B
                macro.
              
            
            
              
                Implemented experimental support for Windows ARM target with MSVC.
              
            
            
              
                Implemented experimental support for DEC Alpha target with GCC.
              
            
            
              
                Improved support for ARMv6 and later with GCC. Implemented all atomic
                operations as assembler blocks instead of CAS-based loops. 64-bit
                operations are supported with ARMv7.
              
            
            
              
                Implemented optional support for the BOOST_ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT
                macro and static initialization of atomic_flag.
                (#8158)
              
            
            
              
                Fixed compilation for SPARCv9 target. (#9446)
              
            
            
              
                Fixed compilation for PowerPC target. (#9447)
              
            
            
              
                Fixed several compatibility problems with Clang on x86 and x86-64.
                (#9610, #9842)
              
            
            
              
                Removed specialized code for Windows on IA64 platform.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Circular Buffer:
          
            
              
                #9970,#9334 Support for the C++11 allocator model.
              
            
            
              
                Dropped support of antique compilers.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Concept Check:
          
            
              
                Fewer warnings (includes #5012).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Container:
          
            
              
                Added DlMalloc-based Extended Allocators.
              
            
            
              
                Improved configurability of tree-based ordered associative containers.
                AVL, Scapegoat and Splay trees are now available to implement set, multiset,
                map and multimap.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed bugs:

                ABI breaking: #9221
                showed that BOOST_INTERPROCESS_MSG_QUEUE_CIRCULAR_INDEX
                option of message queue, was completely broken so an ABI break was
                necessary to have a working implementation.
              
            
            
              
                Simplified, refactored and unified (timed_)lock code based on try_lock().
                There were several bugs when handling timeout expirations.
              
            
            
              
                Changed the implementation of condition variables' destructors to
                allow POSIX semantics (the condition variable can be destroyed after
                all waiting threads have been woken up)..
              
            
            
              
                Added BOOST_INTERPROCESS_SHARED_DIR_PATH

                objects when implemented as memory mapped files.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for BOOST_USE_WINDOWS_H.
                When this macro is defined Interprocess does not declare used Windows
                API function and types, includes all needed windows SDK headers and
                uses types and functions declared by the Windows SDK.

                      The default presentation for incomplete named scope lists has
                      changed: trailing scope delimiter is omitted.

                      By default Boost.Log uses Boost.Regex internally as the regular
                      expressions backend. The backend can be changed by defining
                      configuration macros.

                      Fixed a possible infinite block of the logging threads in the

          Math:
          
            
              
                Breaking change: moved a number
                of non-core headers that are predominantly used for internal maintenance
                into libs/math/include_private. The headers effected
                are boost/math/tools/test_data.hpp, boost/math/tools/remez.hpp,
                boost/math/constants/generate.hpp, boost/math/tools/solve.hpp,
                boost/math/tools/test.hpp. You can continue to use these
                headers by adding libs/math/include_private
                to your compiler's include path.
              
            
            
              
                Breaking change: A number of distributions
                and special functions were returning the maximum finite value rather
                than raising an overflow_error, this has now been fixed, which means
                these functions now behave as documented. However, since the default
                behavior on raising an overflow_error is to throw a std::overflow_error exception, applications
                which have come to reply rely on these functions not throwing may
                experience exceptions where they did not before. The special functions
                involved are gamma_p_inva, gamma_q_inva, ibeta_inva, ibetac_inva,
                ibeta_invb, ibetac_invb, gamma_p_inv, gamma_q_inv. The distributions
                involved are pareto_distrib, beta_distrib, geometric_distrib, negative_binomial_distrib,
                binomial_distrib, chi_squared_distrib, gamma_distrib, inverse_chi_squared_distrib,
                inverse_gamma_distrib. See #10111.

                Cleaned up handling of negative values in Bessel I0 and I1 code (removed
                dead code), see #9512.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed handling of very small values passed to tgamma and lgamma so
                they don't generate spurious overflows (thanks to Rocco Romeo).

          Multi-index Containers:
          
            
              
                The erase(iterator)
                member function of hashed indices used to have poor performance under
                low load conditions due to the requirement that an iterator to the
                next element must be returned (see ticket #4264). In accordance
                with the resolution of LWG
                issue #579, this problem has been fixed while maintaining
                the interface of erase,
                at the expense of using one more word of memory per element. In fact,
                C++ complexity requirements on unordered associative containers have
                been improved for hashed indices so that
              
              
                
                  
                    deletion of a given element is unconditionally constant-time,
                  
                
                
                  
                    worst-case performance is not O(n) but O(ndist), where ndist is the number of
                    non-equivalent elements in the index.
                  
                
              
              
                Due to the fact that hashed indices rely on a new data structure,
                the internal representation of their iterators and local iterators
                have changed, which affects serialization: their corresponding serialization
                class
                version has been bumped from 0 to 1. Old archives involving
                hashed index (local) iterators can be loaded by Boost 1.56 version
                of Boost.MultiIndex, but not the other way around.
              
            
            
              
                Hashed indices now provide reserve.
              
            
            
              
                Hashed indices can now be checked for equality and inequality following
                the (suitably adapted) C++ standard specification in [unord.req].
              
            
            
              
                The public interface of Boost.MultiIndex provide noexcept
                specifications where appropriate (for compliant compilers).
              
            
            
              
                Improved performance of failed insertions into a multi_index_container.
              
            
            
              
                Much internal code aimed at supporting MSVC++ 7.0 and prior has been
                removed. Compilation times without this legacy code might be slightly
                faster.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a bug with insertion via iterators dereferencing to rvalues
                (ticket #9665).
              
            
            
              
                Made Boost.MultiIndex compatible with BOOST_BIND_NO_PLACEHOLDERS

                appropriate algebras and operations.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for Eigen, Boost.Multiarray, Boost.Mpi, Boost.Compute,
                Blaze, and NT2.
              
            
            
              
                Changed algebra interface to use algebra.norm_inf function.
              
            
            
              
                Added iterators for iterating through the solution of the ODEs, hence
                an alternative to the integrate functions.
              
            
            
              
                Added the Velocity-Verlet method.
              
            
            
              
                Minor bug fixes.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Optional:
          
            
              
                Added support for rvalue references. Now optional<T> works with moveable but non-copyable
                T's.
              
            
            
              
                Improved swap (now
                uses move operations).
              
            
            
              
                Added function emplace(). This is the last of the requests
                from #1841.
              
            
            
              
                optional is moveable,
                including conditional noexcept
                specifications, which make it move_if_noexcept-friendly.
              
            
            
              
                Using explicit operator bool() on platforms that support it (#4227)
                (breaking change).
              
            
            
              
                Forward declaration of operator<<(ostream&, optional
                const&)
                to prevent inadvertent incorrect serialization of optional objects.
              
            
            
              
                Removed depprecated function reset() from examples (#9005).
              
            
            
              
                Equality comparison with boost::none
                does not require that T
                be EqualityComparable.
              
            
            
              
                Optional rvalue references are explicitly disallowed.
              
            
            
              
                Binding temporaries to optional references is explicitly disallowed
                (breaking change).
              
            
            
              
                More ways to access the contained value, functions value(),
                value_or(),
                value_or_eval().
              
            
            
              
                Updated and reorganized documentation, added tutorial and quick guide
                sections.

                Detection of ARM architecture for Windows compilers to target mobile
                devices of Windows 8.
              
            
            
              
                Improved ARM detection for 64 bit ARM.
              
            
            
              
                Added detection of iOS as an operating system.

                Addition of exclusive plus emulated definitions for platform and
                compiler detection.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Preprocessor:
          
            
              
                When using variadic macros tuple functionality was added to match
                all the array functionality.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Program Options:
          
            
              
                Columns in the --help
                output are now aligned across all option groups (#6114).
              
            
            
              
                Option names with dashes are no longer truncated in error messages
                (#8009).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Regex:
          
            
              
                Breaking change: corrected behavior
                of basic_regex<>::mark_count()
                to match existing documentation, basic_regex<>::subexpression(n) changed to match, see #9227
              
            
            
              
                Fixed issue #8903.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed documentation typos from #9283.

          Smart Pointers:
          
            
              
                Updated the overloads of make_shared
                and allocate_shared
                of array types (T[] or T[N]) to conform to the specification
                in C++ standard paper N3939
                and significantly reduced the spatial overhead of the internal bookkeeping
                structures.
              
            
            
              
                Updated the implementations of make_shared and allocate_shared for
                scalar types and array types, respectively, to resolve C++ standard
                library defect report #2070.

          Utility:
          
            
              
                Some components were moved to the new Boost.Core library.
              
            
            
              
                empty_deleter is
                deprecated in favor of null_deleter
                from Boost.Core. empty_deleter
                is an alias for null_deleter,
                it will be removed in future releases.
              
            
            
              
                base_from_member
                utility now supports lvalue reference member types. (#7577)
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          UUID:
          
            
              
                Added basic support for C++11 features.
              
            
            
              
                Implemented SSE-optimized versions of some functions of uuid, including comparison operators
                and swap. The support
                for different versions of SSE is automatically detected at compile
                time for most compilers, but can also be explicitly enabled or disabled
                with configuration
                macros. (#8509)
              
            
            
              
                Silenced some compiler warnings. (#8495, #8697)
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Variant:
          
            
              
                Breaking change: Variant now uses
                variadic templates if they are supported by compiler. This leads
                to smaller binaries and better compilation times but in some cases
                may break metaprogramming functions, especially if BOOST_VARIANT_ENUM_PARAMS
                and BOOST_VARIANT_ENUM_SHIFTED_PARAMS
                are not used. Usage of variadic templates may
                be disabled.
              
            
            
              
                Added
                polymorphic_get function
                #9479.
              
            
            
              
                Move-only classes now can be returned by visitors.
              
            
            
              
                Optimized variant::swap() and fixed ambiguity in move_swap
                #2839.
              
            
            
              
                Added conditional noexcepts to move assignments, default and move
                constructors making boost::variant
                move_if_noexcept-friendly
                (#7911).
              
            
            
              
                Exceptions are now visible across modules even with -fvisibility=hidden
                flags.
              
            
            
              
                Dropped support of antique compilers.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed some warnings (#3020).
