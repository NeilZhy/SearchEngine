                      completly refactored in version 2.0.0

                      are depreceated. You should use the parameterized form __duration_fmt
                      or the renamed manipulators __duration_symbol and __duration_prefix
                      instead.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      chrono I/O: The __duration_punct<> facet is depreceated.
                      You should use the __get_duration_style free function to get
                      the informations and use the __duration_units facet for localization
                      purposes.

                Added versions of A* search specifically for trees, removing the
                need for a color map when it is acceptable to visit the same vertex
                multiple times.

                      Glen Fernandes provided implementations of make_shared and
                      allocate_shared for arrays. They achieve a single allocation
                      for an array that can be initialized with constructor arguments
                      or initializer lists as well as overloads for default initialization
                      and no value initialization. See the 'make_shared
                      and allocate_shared for arrays' page for more information.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      shared_ptr
                      can now be used to hold a pointer to a dynamically allocated
                      array. This is accomplished by using an array type (T[]
                      or T[N])
                      as the template parameter.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Smart pointers now use explicit
                      operator bool
                      on C++11 compilers. This can break code that passes a smart
                      pointer to a function taking a bool,
                      or that returns a smart pointer from a function with a bool return type. Please use
                      p !=
                      0 or !!p in such cases.
