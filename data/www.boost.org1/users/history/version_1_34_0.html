    New Libraries
    
      
        
          Foreach Library: BOOST_FOREACH macro for easily iterating
          over the elements of a sequence, from Eric Niebler.
        
      
      
        
          Statechart
          Library:
  Arbitrarily complex finite state machines can be implemented
          in easily readable and maintainable C++ code, from Andreas Huber.
        
      
      
        
          TR1 Library: An
          implementation of the C++ Technical Report on Standard Library Extensions,
          from John Maddock. This library does not itself implement the TR1 components,
          rather it's a thin wrapper that will include your standard library's TR1
          implementation (if it has one), otherwise it will include the Boost Library
          equivalents, and import them into namespace std::tr1.
          Highlights include: Reference Wrappers, Smart Pointers, result_of, Function
          Object Binders, Polymorphic function wrappers, Type Traits, Random Number
          Generators and Distributions, Tuples, Fixed Size Array, Hash Function Objects,
          Regular Expressions, and Complex Number Additional Algorithms.
        
      
      
        
          Typeof Library: Typeof
          operator emulation, from Arkadiy Vertleyb and Peder Holt.
        
      
      
        
          Xpressive
          Library: Regular expressions that can be written as strings or as
          expression templates, and that can refer to each other and themselves recursively
          with the power of context-free grammars, from Eric Niebler.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Assign Library:
          
            
              
                Support for ptr_map<key,T> via the new function ptr_map_insert()
              
            
            
              
                Support for initialization of Pointer
                Containers when the containers hold pointers to an abstract
                base class.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Date_time
          library:
          
            
              
                Support for new US/Canada timezone rules and other bug fixes. See
                Change
                History for details.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Filesystem
          Library: Major upgrade in preparation for submission to the C++
          Standards Committee for TR2. Changes include:
          
            
              
                Internationalization,
                provided by class templates basic_path, basic_filesystem_error,
                basic_directory_iterator, and basic_directory_entry.
              
            
            
              
                Simplification
                of the path interface by eliminating special constructors to identify
                native formats.
              
            
            
              
                Rationalization
                of predicate function design, including the addition of several new
                functions.
              
            
            
              
                Clearer specification by reference to POSIX,
                the ISO/IEEE Single Unix Standard, with provisions for Windows and
                other operating systems.
              
            
            
              
                Preservation
                of existing user code whenever possible.
              
            
            
              
                More
                efficient directory iteration.
              
            
            
              
                Addition of a recursive
                directory iterator.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Function
          Library:
  Boost.Function now implements a small buffer optimization,
          which can drastically improve the performance when copying or constructing
          Boost.Function objects storing small function objects. For instance, bind(&X:foo, &x, _1, _2) requires no heap allocation when placed
          into a Boost.Function object.
        
      
      
        
          Functional/Hash
          Library:
          
            
              
                Use declarations for standard classes, so that the library doesn't
                need to include all of their headers
              
            
            
              
                Deprecated the <boost/functional/hash/*.hpp>
                headers.
              
            
            
              
                Add support for the BOOST_HASH_NO_EXTENSIONS
                macro, which disables the extensions to TR1
              
            
            
              
                Minor improvements to the hash functions for floating point numbers.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Graph Library:
          
            
              
                edmonds_maximum_cardinality_matching,
                from Aaron Windsor.
              
            
            
              
                lengauer_tarjan_dominator_tree,
                from JongSoo Park.
              
            
            
              
                compressed_sparse_row_graph,
                from Jeremiah Willcock and Douglas Gregor of Indiana University.
              
            
            
              
                sorted_erdos_renyi_iterator,
                from Jeremiah Willcock of Indiana University.
              
            
            
              
                biconnected_components
                now supports a visitor and named parameters, from Janusz Piwowarski.
              
            
            
              
                adjacency_matrix now models
                the Bidirectional
                Graph concept.
              
            
            
              
                dijkstra_shortest_paths
                now calls vis.initialize_vertex for each vertex
                during initialization.
              
            
            
              
                Note: the name of the compiled library for the
                GraphViz
                reader has changed to boost_graph (from
                bgl-viz) to match Boost conventions.
              
            
            
              
                See the complete
                revision history for more information.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          MultiArray
          Library:
  Boost.MultiArray now by default provides range-checking
          for operator[].
          Range checking can be disabled by defining the macro BOOST_DISABLE_ASSERTS
          before including multi_array.hpp. A bug in multi_array::resize()
          related to storage orders was fixed.
        
      
      
        
          Multi-index
          Containers Library:
          
            
              
                New random
                access indices.
              
            
            
              
                Non key-based indices feature new rearrange
                facilities.
              
            
            
              
                This version also includes a number of optimizations and usage improvements.
                For a complete list of changes, see the library release
                notes.

                boost::none_t and
                boost::none now added to Optional's documentation
              
            
            
              
                Relational operators now directly support arguments of type 'T' and 'none_t'
              
            
            
              
                operator->() now also works with reference types.
              
            
            
              
                Helper functions make_optional(val), make_optional(cond,val) and get_optional_value_or(opt,alternative_value)
                added.
              
            
            
              
                Constructor taking a boolean condition (as well as a value) added.
              
            
            
              
                Member function get_value_or(alternative_value) added.
              
            
            
              
                Incompatbility bug with mpl::apply<> fixed.
              
            
            
              
                Converting assignment bug with uninitialized lvalues fixed.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Parameter
          Library:
          
            
              
                Every ArgumentPack is now a valid MPL
                Forward Sequence.
              
            
            
              
                Support for unnamed arguments (those whose keyword is deduced from
                their types) is added.
              
            
            
              
                Support for named and unnamed template arguments is added.

                Support for serialization via Boost.Serialization.
              
            
            
              
                Exceptions can be disabled by defining the macro BOOST_PTR_CONTAINER_NO_EXCEPTIONS
                before including any header. This macro is defined by default if
                BOOST_NO_EXCEPTIONS is defined.
              
            
            
              
                Additional std::auto_ptr<T>
                overloads added s.t. one can also pass std::auto_ptr<T> instead of only T*
                arguments to member functions.
              
            
            
              
                transfer()
                now has weaker requirements s.t. one can transfer objects from ptr_container<Derived>
                to ptr_container<Base>,
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Python Library:
          
            
              
                Boost.Python now automatically appends C++ signatures to docstrings.
                The new docstring_options.hpp
                header is available to control the content of docstrings.
              
            
            
              
                stl_input_iterator, for
                turning a Python iterable object into an STL input iterator, from

                Integrated support for wrapping C++ functions built with the parameter
                library; keyword names are automatically known to docsstrings.
              
            
            
              
                Enhancements to the API for better embedding support (boost::python::import(),

          Wave Library:
          
            
              
                Wave now correctly recognizes pp-number tokens as mandated by the
                C++ Standard, which are converted to C++ tokens right before they
                are returned from the library.
              
            
            
              
                Several new preprocessing hooks have been added. For a complete description
                please refer to the related documentation page: The
                Context Policy.
              
            
            
              
                Shared library (dll) support has been added for the generated Wave
                libraries.
              
            
            
              
                The overall error handling has been improved. It is now possible
                to recover and continue after an error or a warning was issued.
              
            
            
              
                Support for optional comment and/or full whitespace preservation
                in the generated output stream has been added.
              
            
            
              
                The Wave library now performs automatic include guard detection to
                avoid accessing header files more than once, if appropriate.
              
            
            
              
                Full interactive mode has been added to the Wave tool. Now the Wave
                tool can be used just like Python or Perl for instance to interactively
                try out your BOOST_PP macros. Additionally it is now possible to
                load and save the current state of an interactive session (macro
                tables et.al.).
              
            
            
              
                The overall performance has been improved by upto 40-60%, depending
                on the concrete files to process.
              
            
            
              
                Support for new pragmas has been added allowing to control certain
                library features from inside the preprocessed sources (partial output
                redirection, control of generated whitespace and #line directives).
              
            
            
              
                Optional support for #pragma message "..." has been added.
              
            
            
              
                This version also includes a number of bug fixes and usage improvements.
                For a complete list of changes, see the libraries change
                log.
              
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
    Supported Compilers
    
      Boost is tested on a wide range of compilers and platforms. Since Boost libraries
      rely on modern C++ features not available in all compilers, not all Boost libraries
      will work with every compiler. The following compilers and platforms have been
      extensively tested with Boost, although many other compilers and platforms
      will work as well. For more information, see the regression
      test results.

          C++ 8.0, which may result in many spurious warnings from Boost headers
          and other standards-conforming C++ code. To suppress these warnings, define
          the macro _SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE.
