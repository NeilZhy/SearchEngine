          Locale
          Patch - Fixes a bug which causes boost::locale::utf::utf_traits
          to accept some invalid UTF-8 sequences, which is a possible security flaw.

                      version 2 solves this issue. You should move to the new version.

                ABI breaking: Reimplemented message_queue
                with a circular buffer index (the old behavior used an ordered array,
                leading to excessive copies). This should greatly increase performance
                but breaks ABI. Old behaviour/ABI can be used undefining macro BOOST_INTERPROCESS_MSG_QUEUE_CIRCULAR_INDEX

                Improved message_queue

                Implemented interproces_sharable_mutex
                and interproces_condition_any.

                      #5825 constructing function_input_iterator without consuming

                Breaking changes:
                
                  
                    
                      Due to the fix for #5825, a function_input_iterator will
                      no longer make unnecessary invokations to the wrapped nullary
                      function. For example, constructing an end iterator will now
                      not trigger an invokation; and dereferencing-and-incrementing
                      an iterator N times will trigger N invokations, not N+1 as
                      before. User code that relied on the old behavior will need
                      to be adjusted.

                In several distributions (particulary the Students T) corrected moments

                #6934
                (reported by Florian Schoppmann) by adding a function check_out_of_range to test many
                possible bad parameters. This test revealed several distributions
                where the checks for bad parameters were ineffective, and these have
                been rectified.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed issue in Hankel functions that causes incorrect values to be

                Also much enhanced accuracy for large degrees of freedom and/or large
                non-centrality parameters by switching to use the Students t distribution
                (or Normal distribution for infinite degrees of freedom) centered
                at delta, when delta / (4 * v) < epsilon for the floating-point
                type in use. See #7259.
                It was also found that the incomplete beta was suffering from serious
                cancellation errors when degrees of freedom was very large. (That
                has now been fixed in our code, but any code based on Didonato and
                Morris's original papers (probably every implementation out there
                actually) will have the same issue).

                Deprecated Features: Deprecated features since
                boost 1.50 available only until boost 1.55. These deprecated features
                will be provided by default up to boost 1.52. If you don't want to
                include the deprecated features you could define BOOST_THREAD_DONT_PROVIDE_DEPRECATED_FEATURES_SINCE_V3_0_0.
                Since 1.53 these features will not be included any more by default.
                Since this version, if you want to include the deprecated features
                yet you could define BOOST_THREAD_PROVIDE_DEPRECATED_FEATURES_SINCE_V3_0_0.
                These deprecated features will be only available until boost 1.55,
                that is you have yet 1 year to move to the new features.

                (Default value since Boost 1.53): There are some new features which
                share the same interface but with different behavior. These breaking
                features are provided by default when BOOST_THREAD_VERSION is 3,
                but the user can however choose the version 2 behavior by defining
                the corresponding macro. As for the deprecated features, these broken
                features will be only available until boost 1.55.
