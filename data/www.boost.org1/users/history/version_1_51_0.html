          Locale
          Patch - Fixes a bug which causes boost::locale::utf::utf_traits
          to accept some invalid UTF-8 sequences, which is a possible security flaw.
        
      
    
  
  
    New Libraries
    
      
        
          Context:
  Context switching library,
          from Oliver Kowalke.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Algorithm:
          
            
              
                Fixed is_sorted_until
                ; now matches the c++11 standard behavior on ranges with duplicate
                values.
              
            
            
              
                Added range support for the rest of the search algorithms.
              
            
            
              
                unhex now uses Boost.Exception
                to signal bad input.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Fixed an incompatibility between ip::tcp::iostream
                and C++11 (#7162).
              
            
            
              
                Decorated GCC attribute names with underscores to prevent interaction
                with user-defined macros (#6415).
              
            
            
              
                Added missing #include
                <cctype>, needed for some versions of
                MinGW.
              
            
            
              
                Changed to use gcc's atomic builtins on ARM CPUs,
                when available (#7140).
              
            
            
              
                Changed strand destruction to be a no-op, to allow strand objects
                to be destroyed after their associated io_service
                has been destroyed.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for some newer versions of glibc which provide the
                epoll_create1()
                function but always fail with ENOSYS
                (#7012).
              
            
            
              
                Changed the SSL implementation to throw an exception if SSL engine
                initialisation fails (#6303).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed another regression in buffered_write_stream
                (#6310).
              
            
            
              
                Implemented various minor performance improvements, primarily targeted
                at Linux x86 and x86-64 platforms.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Config:
          
            
              
                Deprecated a whole bunch of macros that were c++11 specific, but
                not named to show that they were c++11 specific. Made new macros
                with better names, and paired the old macros with the new ones. Updated
                the documentation to list the deprecated macros.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Chrono:
          
            
              
                #6918
                Boost Chrono compilation failure on HP uX due to undefined pthread_getcpuclockid.
              
            
            
              
                #6241
                boost::chrono compilation problems without std::wstring support.
              
            
            
              
                #6987
                Documentation & C++11.
              
            
            
              
                #7041
                time_point.hpp depends on Boost.System.
              
            
            
              
                #7042
                Avoiding time_point and duration dependency on time.h and CLOCK_REALTIME.
              
            
            
              
                #7058
                Make it work when BOOST_NO_EXCEPTIONS is defined.
              
            
            
              
                #7069
                Misspellings in clock_string<thread_clock>.
              
            
            
              
                #7081
                WinError.h capitalization in boost/detail/win/basic_types.hpp.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Geometry:
          
            
              
                points accessed through a pointer (e.g. in a linestring) should now
                be specialized without the pointer. In previous versions a type
                my_point used like
                linestring<my_point*>
                had to be specalized like: template<> struct
                tag<my_point*>.
                Now the library itself removes the pointer before calling the traits
                class, so now it should be like: template<> struct
                tag<my_point>
              
            
            
              
                intersection was sometimes wrong for integer points, fixed
              
            
            
              
                documentation, order of parameters in simplify was wrong, fixed
              
            
            
              
                7030
                spherical distance, fixed (by patch of Karsten Ahnert)

                Refactored support for internal and bundled properties in Boost.Graph-provided
                graph types, and cleaned up named parameter functionality:
                
                  
                    
                      Enabled old-style (non-bundled) internal properties in compressed_sparse_row_graph.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Bundled properties should work correctly for all graph types
                      and adaptors.

                Better performance, less memory usage for boost::array<character_type, N> and std::array<character_type, N> conversions.
