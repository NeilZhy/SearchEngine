    This is a bug fix release addressing many problems with the 1.34.0 release. It
    is a recommended upgrade for all users of Boost 1.34.0. For a complete list of
    fixes see Boost
    Trac.
  
  
    Supported Compilers
    
      New in this release is improved support for the IBM XL C/C++ compiler.
    
    
      Boost is tested on a wide range of compilers and platforms. Since Boost libraries
      rely on modern C++ features not available in all compilers, not all Boost libraries
      will work with every compiler. New in this release The following compilers
      and platforms have been extensively tested with Boost, although many other
      compilers and platforms will work as well. For more information, see the regression test results.

          support the non-standard "Safe" C++ Library shipping with Visual
          C++ 8.0, which may result in many spurious warnings from Boost headers
          and other standards-conforming C++ code. To suppress these warnings, define
          the macro _SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE.
