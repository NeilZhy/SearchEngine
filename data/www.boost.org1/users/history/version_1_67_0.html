    Known Issues
    
      These are patches from library authors which were found too late to be fixed
      in the release. Be careful as they have not been through the normal testing
      process.

  Contract programming
            for C++. All contract programming features are supported: Subcontracting,
            class invariants, postconditions (with old and return values), preconditions,
            customizable actions on assertion failure (e.g., terminate or throw),
            optional compilation and checking of assertions, etc, from Lorenzo Caminiti.

            Asio:
            
              
                
                  Added missing const qualifier to basic_socket_acceptor::get_option.
                
              
              
                
                  Worked around a parsing error that occurs with some versions of
                  gcc.
                
              
              
                
                  Fixed broken code samples in tutorial.
                
              
              
                
                  Added new experimental features. (Note that "experimental"
                  features may be changed without notice in subsequent releases.)
                  
                    
                      
                        Added experimental::detached
                        completion token.
                      
                    
                    
                      
                        Added experimental::redirect_error
                        completion token.
                      
                    
                    
                      
                        Added experimental::co_spawn
                        facility for integration with the coroutines technical specification.
                      
                    
                    
                      
                        Updated timeout examples to use latest features.
                      
                    
                    
                      
                        Used asio::steady_timer
                        rather than asio::deadline_timer.
                      
                    
                    
                      
                        Used asio::dynamic_buffer
                        rather than asio::streambuf.
                      
                    
                    
                      
                        Used timed asio::io_context::run_for() function for blocking clients.
                      
                    
                    
                      
                        Added example showing a custom completion token for blocking
                        with timeouts.
                      
                    
                  
                
              
              
                
                  Fixed unit tests to compile when BOOST_ASIO_NO_DEPRECATED
                  is defined.
                
              
              
                
                  Changed socket iostreams to use chrono by default, to fix compatibility
                  with the Networking TS. Define BOOST_ASIO_USE_BOOST_DATE_TIME_FOR_SOCKET_IOSTREAM
                  to enable the old Boost.Date_Time interface in basic_socket_streambuf
                  and basic_socket_iostream.
                
              
              
                
                  Updated examples to use chrono rather than Boost.Date_Time.
                
              
              
                
                  Fixed an incorrect member function detector in the is_dynamic_buffer trait.
                
              
              
                
                  Fixed an async_result
                  incompatibility with deprecated handler_type.
                
              
              
                
                  Added a missing move optimisation in the SSL stream implementation.
                
              
              
                
                  Fixed incorrect basic_resolver_results::value_type
                  typedef.
                
              
              
                
                  Fixed a compile error with some OpenSSL versions when SSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION is defined.
                
              
              
                
                  Changed add_certificate_authority
                  to process multiple certificates in a bundle.
                
              
              
                
                  Eliminated deprecation warning with MSVC by using std::invoke_result rather than std::result_of.
                
              
              
                
                  Changed to use std::string_view
                  for C++17 or later, and std::experimental::string_view
                  for C++14. Define the preprocessor macro BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_STD_STRING_VIEW
                  to force the use of std::experimental::string_view (assuming it
                  is available) when compiling in C++17 mode.
                
              
              
                
                  Ensured DynamicBuffer
                  template arguments are decayed before using in enable_if
                  tests.
                
              
              
                
                  Changed documentation to distinguish legacy completion handlers
                  (which are still required to be CopyConstructible) from new MoveConstructible
                  handlers.
                
              
              
                
                  Suppressed a discarded return value warning in the buffer debugging
                  support.
                
              
              
                
                  Fixed basic_yield_context
                  to work with completion signatures containing reference parameters.
                
              
              
                
                  Ensured that stackful coroutines launched using spawn() correctly store decayed copies
                  of their function and handler arguments.
                
              
              
                
                  Fixed some compatibility issues with Android.
                
              
              
                
                  Added cross-compilation support to Jamfiles.
                
              
              
                
                  Fixed some minor portability issues in examples.
                
              
            
          
        
        
          
            Atomic:
            
              
                
                  Breaking change: Changed the result
                  of the (op)_and_test
                  operations added in Boost 1.66 to the opposite - the functions
                  now return true if
                  the operation result is non-zero. This is consistent with other
                  test methods in
                  Boost.Atomic and the C++ standard library. Users can define BOOST_ATOMIC_DETAIL_HIGHLIGHT_OP_AND_TEST
                  when compiling their code to emit warnings on every use of the
                  changed functions. This way users can locate the code that needs
                  to be updated. (#11)
                
              
              
                
                  Update for C++2a. On C++11 compilers that support scoped enums,
                  the memory_order
                  enumeration is now scoped and contains constants with shorter names
                  like acquire,
                  release or seq_cst (i.e. users can use
                  memory_order::acquire instead of memory_order_acquire). The old
                  constants are also provided for backward compatibility. (P0439R0)
                
              
              
                
                  Update for C++2a. Added experimental support for atomic operations
                  on floating point types. In addition to general operations, add, sub,
                  negate operations
                  and their fetch_(op) and opaque_(op) versions are supported. Lock-free
                  property can be tested with the new macros BOOST_ATOMIC_FLOAT/DOUBLE/LONG_DOUBLE_LOCK_FREE.
                  The support for floating point types is optional and can be disabled
                  by defining BOOST_ATOMIC_NO_FLOATING_POINT.
                  (P0020R6)
                
              
              
                
                  Added new experimental operations:
                  
                    
                      
                        negate_and_test
                        and complement_and_test
                        which perform negation or bitwise complement and return
                        true if the
                        result is not zero.
                      
                    
                    
                      
                        add, sub, negate,
                        bitwise_and,
                        bitwise_or,
                        bitwise_xor,
                        bitwise_complement
                        operations which perform the operation and return its result.
                      
                    
                  
                
              
              
                
                  For generic atomic<T> specialization, the default
                  constructor is now trivial if T's
                  default constructor is.
                
              
              
                
                  The internal implementation of atomic<T> has been updated to avoid undefined
                  behavior that stems from signed integer overflows. As required
                  by the C++ standard, the library uses two's complement representation
                  of signed integers internally and accroding rules of overflow.
                  Currently, the library requires the native signed integer types
                  to also use two's complement representation (but no defined overflow
                  semantics).
                
              
              
                
                  Improved Clang support. In particular, fixed DCAS not being lock-free
                  and fixed possible incorrect code generated on 32-bit x86.
                
              
              
                
                  Improved MinGW support. For gcc versions up to 4.6, fixed compilation
                  of DCAS on x86.
                
              
              
                
                  In x86 PIE code, asm blocks now preserve ebx

            Multiprecision:
            
              
                
                  Breaking Change: When converting
                  a multiprecision integer to a narrower type, if the value is too
                  large (or negative) to fit in the smaller type, then the result
                  is either the maximum (or minimum) value of the target type. This
                  was always the intended behaviour, but was somewhat haphazardly
                  enforced before. If you really do want just the low order N bits
                  of a value, then you will need to mask these out prior to the case,
                  for example: static_cast<unsigned>(~static_cast<unsigned>(0) &
                  my_value).
                  Note that technically (to avoid undefined behaviour) you should
                  do the same thing with built in integer types too. See #13109.

                  The library name now includes the version suffix of the Python
                  version used to compile it. For example, a variant compiled with
                  Python 2.7 will produce library names boost_python27
                  and boost_numpy27,
                  etc.. Combined with a related fix in Boost.Build, this means that
                  it is now possible to build variants for multiple Python versions
                  in a single build process.
