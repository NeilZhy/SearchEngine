    Note about
    the new Visual Studio release
    
      Visual Studio 15.5 was released too late for us to test this release with it.
    
  
  
    New Libraries
    
      
        
          Beast:
  Portable HTTP, WebSocket,
          and network operations using only C++11 and Boost.Asio, from Vinnie Falco.
        
      
      
        
          CallableTraits:
  A spiritual
          successor to Boost.FunctionTypes, Boost.CallableTraits is a header-only
          C++11 library for the compile-time inspection and manipulation of all 'callable'
          types. Additional support for C++17 features, from Barrett Adair.
        
      
      
        
          Mp11:
  A C++11 metaprogramming library,
          from Peter Dimov.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Implemented interface changes to reflect the Networking TS (N4656).
                
                  
                    
                      See the list
                      of new interfaces and, where applicable, the corresponding
                      old interfaces that have been superseded.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      The service template parameters, and the corresponding classes,
                      are disabled by default. For example, instead of basic_socket<Protocol,
                      SocketService>
                      we now have simply basic_socket<Protocol>. The old interface can
                      be enabled by defining the BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_OLD_SERVICES
                      macro.
                    
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                Removed previously deprecated functions.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for customised handler tracking.
              
            
            
              
                Added reactor-related (i.e. descriptor readiness) events to handler
                tracking.
              
            
            
              
                Added special "concurrency hint" values that may be used
                to disable locking on a per io_context
                basis.
              
            
            
              
                Enabled perfect forwarding for the first ssl::stream<> constructor argument.
              
            
            
              
                Added ability to release ownership of the underlying native socket.
                (Requires Windows 8.1 or later when using the I/O completion port
                backend.)
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Atomic:
          
            
              
                Implemented a set of experimental extended atomic operations for
                integral types:
                
                  
                    
                      fetch_negate,
                      fetch_complement
                      - atomically replaces the value with a negated or binary complemented
                      value and returns the original value
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      opaque_<op>
                      - equivalent to fetch_<op> except that it doesn't
                      return the original value
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      <op>_and_test
                      - atomically applies <op>
                      and returns true
                      if the result is zero. Note:
                      The result of these operations will change to the opposite
                      in Boost 1.67. The code that uses these functions will need
                      to be updated.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      bit_test_and_set,
                      bit_test_and_reset,
                      bit_test_and_complement
                      - atomically sets, resets or complements the specified bit
                      and returns the original value of the bit
                    
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                Following C++17 (P0558R1),
                arithmetic operations for pointers to non-object types are no longer
                provided.
              
            
            
              
                Also following C++17 exposed atomic<T>::value_type
                and atomic<T>::difference_type member typedefs,
                where applicable, to the user's code.
              
            
            
              
                Improved compatibility with gcc 7. In particular, using 128-bit operations
                on x86-64 should no longer require linking with libatomic (the compiler-supplied
                library).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          DateTime:
          
            
              
                The library has been converted to use Boost.WinAPI as the abstraction
                layer for Windows SDK.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed an integral overflow that could cause incorrect results when
                adding or subtracting many years from a date (see here).

                      Fixes in results of union/intersection/difference which could
                      be incorrect in very complex cases

                next()/prior()
                functions now support user's iterators that don't specify nested
                types such as iterator_category,
                difference_type,
                etc. and instead specialize std::iterator_traits
                to define those types. The compiler must support C++17-compatible
                std::iterator_traits for this to work.

                      Fixed a bug in file_collector::scan_for_files

                New Features:
                
                  
                    
                      Add Gauss and Gauss-Kronrod quadrature routines.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Add double-exponential (tanh-sinh, exp-sinh and sinh-sinh)
                      quadrature routines.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Add Chebyshev polynomial evaluation, roots, integration, differentiation,
                      and interpolation routines.
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Multi-index Containers:
          
            
              
                Made modify and
                modify_key more robust
                so that the modified element is erased if the modifier throws or
                the rollback functor does not properly restore the element (full
                discussion at ticket #12542). This is technically backwards
                incompatible; for instance, the following code:
              
c.modify(c.begin(),[](auto&){throw 0;});
              
                keeps the container c
                untouched in former versions of Boost whereas now c.begin() is erased. Thanks to Jon Kalb for
                raising the issue.
              
            
            
              
                Maintenance fixes.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Optional:
          
            
              
                On newer compilers optional
                is now trivially-copyable for scalar Ts.
                This uses a different storage (just T
                rather than aligned_storage).
                We require the compiler to support defaulted functions.
              
            
            
              
                Changed the implementation of operator== to get rid of the -Wmaybe-uninitialized
                false-positive warning from GCC.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          PolyCollection:
          
            
              
                Boost.PolyCollection has been backported to GCC 4.8 to 4.9 and Clang
                3.3 to 3.6. The version of libstdc++-v3 shipped with GCC 4.8 (which
                can also be used by Clang) has deficiencies that result in the following
                limitations when using Boost.PolyCollection:
                
                  
                    
                      Stateful allocators are not properly supported.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Allocator-extended move construction decays to allocator-extended
                      copy construction.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Copy construction crashes if an exception is thrown during
                      element copying.

                      Various deficiencies in string_generator
                      were resolved.

                      name_generator::operator() is now const, matching docs.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Detail headers were moved into the detail subdirectory. No
                      changes needed to user's code, however you may get build warnings
                      if you use the old header location.

                boost::apply_visitor now does perfect
                forwarding of visitables #6971. Great thanks to Levon Tarakchyan
                for implementing this feature.
