    Patches
    
      
        
          Locale
          Patch - Fixes a bug which causes boost::locale::utf::utf_traits
          to accept some invalid UTF-8 sequences, which is a possible security flaw.
        
      
    
  
  
    New Libraries
    
      
        
          Heap:
  Priority queue data
          structures, from Tim Blechmann.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Added a new class template basic_waitable_timer
                based around the C++11 clock type requirements. It may be used with
                the clocks from the C++11 <chrono>
                library facility or, if those are not available, Boost.Chrono. The
                typedefs high_resolution_timer,
                steady_timer and
                system_timer may
                be used to create timer objects for the standard clock types.
              
            
            
              
                Added a new windows::object_handle
                class for performing waits on Windows kernel objects. Thanks go to
                Boris Schaeling for contributing substantially to the development
                of this feature.
              
            
            
              
                On Linux, connect() can return EAGAIN in certain circumstances.
                Remapped this to another error so that it doesn't look like a non-blocking
                operation (#6048).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a compile error on NetBSD (#6098).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed deadlock on Mac OS X (#6275).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a regression in buffered_write_stream
                (#6310).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a non-paged pool "leak" on Windows when an io_service is repeatedly run without
                anything to do (#6321).
              
            
            
              
                Reverted earlier change to allow some speculative operations to be
                performed without holding the lock, as it introduced a race condition
                in some multithreaded scenarios.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a bug where the second buffer in an array of two buffers may
                be ignored if the first buffer is empty.

                      #6092
                      Input from non integral durations makes the compiler fail.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      #6093
                      [1/3]second fails as valid duration input.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      #6113
                      duplicate symbol when BOOST_CHRONO_HEADER_ONLY is defined.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      #6243
                      Sandia-pgi-11.9: more than one instance of overloaded function
                      "min" matches.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      #6257
                      process_cpu_clock::now() on linux gives time_points 1/1000
                      times.

                #4383.
              
            
            
              
                Added allocator_traits
                support for both C++11 and C++03 compilers through an internal allocator_traits clone.

                Fix #3714,
                Added test cases and fixes for class path errors when assignment
                or append used self or portion of self as source.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #4889,
                #6320,
                Locale codecvt_facet not thread safe on Windows. Move Windows, Mac
                OS X, locale and codecvt facet back to namespace scope. POSIX except
                OS X uses local static initialization (IE lazy) to ensure exceptions
                are catchable if environmental variables are misconfigured and to
                avoid use of locale("") if not actually used.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #5652,
                recursive_directory_iterator fails on cyclic symbolic links. Thanks
                to Daniel Aarno for the patch.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #5653,
                recursive_directory_iterator(error_code) can still throw filesystem_error.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #5900,
                directory_iterator access violation on Windows if error is thrown.
                Thanks to Andreas Eckleder for the patch.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #5900
                comment 2, a bug in director_iterator construction with error_code
                argument that caused increment to be called without the ec argument
                being passed.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #5989
                by cleaning up test suite path_test.cpp code even though the ticket
                itself was not a defect, and clarifying docs; iteration over a path
                yields generic format.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #5592,
                Change Windows codecvt processing from CP_THREAD_ACP to CP_ACP.
              
            
            
              
                Operations function fixes for PGI compiler, thanks to Noel Belcourt.

                Fixed timed functions in mutex implementations to fulfill POSIX requirements:
                Under no circumstance shall the function fail with a timeout

                parameter need not be checked if the mutex can be locked immediately.
