    New Libraries
    
      
        
          Proto:
          
            
              
                Expression template library and compiler construction toolkit for
                domain-specific embedded languages, from Eric Niebler.
              
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Enhanced CompletionCondition concept with the signature size_t CompletionCondition(error_code
                ec,
                size_t total), where the return value indicates
                the maximum number of bytes to be transferred on the next read or
                write operation. (The old CompletionCondition signature is still
                supported for backwards compatibility).
              
            
            
              
                New windows::overlapped_ptr class to allow arbitrary overlapped I/O
                functions (such as TransmitFile) to be used with Asio.
              
            
            
              
                On recent versions of Linux, an eventfd descriptor is now used (rather
                than a pipe) to interrupt a blocked select/epoll reactor.
              
            
            
              
                Added const overloads of lowest_layer().
              
            
            
              
                Synchronous read, write, accept and connect operations are now thread
                safe (meaning that it is now permitted to perform concurrent synchronous
                operations on an individual socket, if supported by the OS).
              
            
            
              
                Reactor-based io_service implementations now use lazy initialisation
                to reduce the memory usage of an io_service object used only as a
                message queue.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Circular Buffer:
          
            
              
                Added new methods is_linearized() and rotate(const_iterator).
              
            
            
              
                Minor bug fixes and documentation updates.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Dynamic Bitset:
          
            
              
                Constructor "do the right thing" dispatch, a la standard
                sequence containers (follows the proposed resolution of library
                issue 438, currently in the C++0x working
                paper).
              
            
            
              
                Improvements to documentation, code examples and implementation.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Exception:
          
            
              
                Support for non-RTTI builds.
              
            
            
              
                Optimizations.
              
            
            
              
                A new macro BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION
                which can be used instead of boost::throw_exception
                when throwing, to automatically record information about the location
                of the throw in the exception object.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Hash:
          
            
              
                Minor bug fix (ticket
                2264).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Interprocess:
          
            
              
                Added placement insertion (emplace(), emplace_back()...) methods to containers.
              
            
            
              
                Containers can be used now in recursive types.
              
            
            
              
                Minor bug fixes.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Intrusive:
          
            
              
                Intrusive now takes advantage of compilers with variadic templates.
              
            
            
              
                clone_from functions
                now copy predicates and hash functions of associative containers.
              
            
            
              
                Added incremental hashing to unordered containers via incremental<>
                option.
              
            
            
              
                Minor bug fixes.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Math.Special
          Functions:
   Improved accuracy and testing of the inverse hypergeometric
          functions.
        
      
      
        
          Type Traits:
   Added
          better support for the Codegear compiler.
        
      
      
        
          Unordered:
          
            
              
                Rename overload of emplace
                with hint, to emplace_hint
                as specified in n2691.
              
            
            
              
                Provide forwarding headers at <boost/unordered/unordered_map_fwd.hpp>
                and <boost/unordered/unordered_set_fwd.hpp>.
              
            
            
              
                Move all of the implementation inside the boost/unordered
                directory.
