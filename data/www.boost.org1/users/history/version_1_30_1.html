    This release was withdrawn on the 12 Aug 2003.
  
  
    Fixes were made to the following libraries: * The Boost.Lambda
    ..library is now usable with gcc-2.95.2 * Boost.Spirit:
  *
    Fixed. Using MSVC++6 (SP5), calling the assign action with a string value on
    parsers using the file_iterator will not work. * Fixed: using assign semantic
    action in a grammar with a multi_pass iterator adaptor applied to an std::istream_iterator
    resulted in a failure to compile under msvc 7.0. * Fixed: There is a bug in the
    range_run<CharT>::set(range<CharT> const& r)
    function in "../boost/spirit/utility/impl/chset/range_run.ipp". * Fixed:
    handling of trailing whitespace bug (ast_parse/pt_parse related) * Fixed: comment_p
    and end of data bug * Fixed: Most trailing space bug * Fixed: chset<>::operator ~(range<>)
    bug, operator &(chset<>, range<>)
    bug, operator &(range<>, chset<>)
    bug * Fixed: impl::detach_clear bug * Fixed: mismatch closure
    return type bug * Fixed: access_node_d[] and access_match_d[] iterator bugs * Fixed a bug regarding thread
    safety of Phoenix/Spirit closures. * The Boost Template Metaprogramming
    Library (MPL)'s ..typeof implementation is now compatible with Metrowerks
    CodeWarrior Pro8. * Boost.Function: workaround
    for the new Borland patch (version 0x564) and MSVC++ .NET 2003. * Boost.Config, Boost.Format,
    and Boost.Regex ..have been adjusted
    to avoid warnings with GCC-3.3, and Boost.Format also now works with string types
    other than std::string. * Smart
    Pointers:
  * checked_delete
    now works on more platforms * Compatibility with the SunPro compiler * Added
    missing #includes. * Boost.Python:
  * warning suppression for
    finicky compilers * fixed a crashing bug in the raw_function
    facility when no keyword arguments were passed. * Improved conversion of NULL
    shared_ptrs to Python.
