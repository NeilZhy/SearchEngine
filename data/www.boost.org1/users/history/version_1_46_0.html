          Array:
          
            
              
                Added support for cbegin/cend (#4761)
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a problem with the Sun compiler (#4757)
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Fixed an integer overflow problem that occurs when ip::address_v4::broadcast()
                is used on 64-bit platforms.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a problem on older Linux kernels (where epoll is used without
                timerfd support) that prevents timely delivery of deadline_timer
                handlers, after the program has been running for some time (#5045).

                documented (#4532)
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Concept Check:
          
            
              
                fixed warnings with self-assignment (#4918)
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Filesystem:
          
            
              
                Version 3 of the library is now the default.
              
            
            
              
                IBM vacpp: Workaround for compiler bug affecting iterator_facade.
                (#4912)
              
            
            
              
                Verify, clarify, document that <boost/config/user.hpp>
                can be used to specify BOOST_FILESYSTEM_VERSION.
                (#4891)
              
            
            
              
                Replaced C-style assert
                with BOOST_ASSERT.
              
            
            
              
                Undeprecated unique_path(). Instead, add a note mentioning
                the workaround for lack of thread safety and possible change to cwd.
                unique_path()
                is just too convenient to deprecate!
              
            
            
              
                Cleared several GCC warnings.
              
            
            
              
                Changed V2 code to use BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION.
              
            
            
              
                Windows: Fix status() to report non-symlink reparse point
                correctly.
              
            
            
              
                Add symlink_option
                to recursive_directory_iterator,
                allowing control over recursion into directory symlinks. Note that
                the default is changed to not recurse into directory symlinks.
              
            
            
              
                Reference documentation cleanup, including fixing missing and broken
                links, and adding missing functions.
              
            
            
              
                Miscellaneous implementation code cleanup.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Fusion:
          
            
              
                vector copy constructor now copies sequence members in the same order
                on different platforms (#2823)
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Graph:
          
            
              
                Fixed Graphviz output to work on Visual C++ 7.1.
              
            
            
              
                Replaced assert with BOOST_ASSERT.
              
            
            
              
                Changed to Boost.Filesystem v3.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed the following bugs from Trac: #1021,
                #4556,
                #4631,
