    New Libraries
    
      
        
          Uuid:
  A universally unique
          identifier, from Andy Tompkins.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Added a new HTTP Server 4 example illustrating the use of stackless
                coroutines with Asio.
              
            
            
              
                Changed handler allocation and invocation to use boost::addressof
                to get the address of handler objects, rather than applying operator&
                directly (#2977).
              
            
            
              
                Restricted MSVC buffer debugging workaround to 2008, as it causes
                a crash with 2010 beta 2 (#3796,
                #3822).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a problem with the lifetime of handler memory, where Windows
                needs the OVERLAPPED
                structure to be valid until both the initiating function call has
                returned and the completion packet has been delivered.
              
            
            
              
                Don't block signals while performing system calls, but instead restart
                the calls if they are interrupted.
              
            
            
              
                Documented the guarantee made by strand objects with respect to order
                of handler invocation.
              
            
            
              
                Changed strands to use a pool of implementations, to make copying
                of strands cheaper.
              
            
            
              
                Ensured that kqueue support is enabled for BSD platforms (#3626).
              
            
            
              
                Added a boost_ prefix
                to the extern "C"
                thread entry point function (#3809).
              
            
            
              
                In getaddrinfo emulation,
                only check the socket type (SOCK_STREAM
                or SOCK_DGRAM) if
                a service name has been specified. This should allow the emulation
                to work with raw sockets.
              
            
            
              
                Added a workaround for some broken Windows firewalls that make a
                socket appear bound to 0.0.0.0 when it is in fact bound to 127.0.0.1.
              
            
            
              
                Applied a fix for reported excessive CPU usage under Solaris (#3670).
              
            
            
              
                Added some support for platforms that use older compilers such as
                g++ 2.95 (#3743).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Circular Buffer:
          
            
              
                Added methods erase_begin(size_type) and erase_end(size_type) with
                constant complexity for such types of stored elements which do not
                need an explicit destruction e.g. int or double.
              
            
            
              
                Similarly changed implementation of the clear() method and the destructor
                so their complexity is now constant for such types of stored elements
                which do not require an explicit destruction (the complexity for
                other types remains linear).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Fusion:
          
            
              
                The accumulator is the first argument to the functor of fusion::fold and fusion::accumulate
                (#2355).
              
            
            
              
                Added support for associative iterators and views (#3473).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Graph:
          
            
              
                Removed old interface to compressed_sparse_row_graph,
                making new interface the default.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Integer:
          
            
              
                Reverted Trunk to release branch state (i.e. a "known good state").
              
            
            
              
                Fixed issues: 653,
                3084,
                3177,
                3180,
                3568,
                3657,
                2134.
              
            
            
              
                Added long long support to boost::static_log2,
                boost::static_signed_min, boost::static_signed_max,
                boost::static_unsigned_minboost::static_unsigned_max,
                when available.
              
            
            
              
                The argument type and the result type of boost::static_signed_min
                etc are now typedef'd. Formerly, they were hardcoded as unsigned
                long and int respectively. Please, use
                the provided typedefs in new code (and update old code as soon as
                possible).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Iostreams:
          
            
              
                Fixed many outstanding issues. Thanks to Richard Smith for his work
                on this. (#3612,
                #3311,
                #2094,
                #3010,
                #2894,
                #3011,
                #3352,
                #3505).
              
            
            
              
                For more information see the library
                release notes.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Program.Options:
          
            
              
                Information about option name added to a few exception classes and
                various clean ups in exception classes (#3423).
              
            
            
              
                Description wordwrapping in presense of default parameters fixed
                (#2613).
              
            
            
              
                Empty value in configuration file is now permitted (#1537).
              
            
            
              
                Quotes are no longer stripped from string values (#850).
              
            
            
              
                Fix endless loop in case of long default arguments (#689).
              
            
            
              
                Fix compile warning caused by usage of boost::any (#2562).
              
            
            
              
                Fix memory bug in example/response_file.cpp (#3525).
              
            
            
              
                Most compilation warnings were fixed (#3608).
              
            
            
              
                Make column width for description text configurable. (#3703).
              
            
            
              
                Add general split function: split_unix() (#2561).
              
            
            
              
                Enable open config files from given file name (#3264).
              
            
            
              
                Additional flag for required options (#2982).
              
            
            
              
                Enable case insensitive style for command line (#3498).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          PropertyMap:
          
            
              
                Removed old header files (directly in the boost/ directory); they were deprecated
                since 1.40, replaced by headers in boost/property_map/.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Proto:
          
            
              
                Fix const correctness issues with proto::flatten
                and friends (#3364).
              
            
            
              
                Accomodate recent change to fusion::fold,
                remove old support for Doxygen and pre-1.35 Fusion (#3553).
              
            
            
              
                In binary operations, when one operand has a user-specified domain
                and the other has the default domain, the user-specified domain trumps.
              
            
            
              
                Fix BOOST_PROTO_EXTENDS
                to work with elaborated types.
              
            
            
              
                Work around EDG compiler bug with function types and cv-qualification.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Regex:
          
            
              
                Added support for Functors rather than strings as format expressions.
              
            
            
              
                Improved error reporting when throwing exceptions to include better
                more relevant information.
              
            
            
              
                Improved performance and reduced stack usage of recursive expressions.

          Spirit:
  Spirit V2.2,
          see the 'What's
          New' section for details.
        
      
      
        
          Unordered:
          
            
              
                Support instantiating the containers with incomplete value types.
              
            
            
              
                Add erase_return_void
                as a temporary workaround for the current erase
                which can be inefficient because it has to find the next element
                to return an iterator (#3693).
              
            
            
              
                Add templated find overload for compatible keys.
              
            
            
              
                Improved codegear compatibility.

    Compilers Tested
    
      Boost's primary test compilers are:
