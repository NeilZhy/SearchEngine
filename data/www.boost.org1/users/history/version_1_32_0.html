    Important
    - New Toolset Names
    
      The names of some the Boost.Build toolsets
      have been changed to remove the "." (dot) character
      and to fix some other naming inconsistencies. For example, vc7.1
      toolset was renamed to become vc-7_1. Please refer to the
      Supported Toolsets
      section of the installation guide for the complete list of the current toolset
      names. This change was made as a part of the effort to make the Boost distribution
      compatible with ISO 9660 level 2 requirements.

          Python
          Library:
          
            
              
                Updated to use the Boost Software License.
              
            
            
              
                a new, better
                method of wrapping classes with virtual functions has been
                implemented.
              
            
            
              
                Support for the new Python Bool type, thanks to Daniel Holth.
              
            
            
              
                Support for upcoming GCC symbol export control features have been
                folded in, thanks to Niall Douglas.
              
            
            
              
                Improved support for std::auto_ptr-like
                types.
              
            
            
              
                Components used by other libraries have been moved out of python/detail
                and into boost/detail to improve dependency relationships.
              
            
            
              
                Miscellaneous bug fixes and compiler workarounds.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Signals Library: Introduced
          deterministic slot ordering, permitting slots to be connected at the beginning
          or end of slot groups or the slot list itself. Combiners may safely have
          state and are accessible from the signal.
        
      
      
        
          Utility: class
          template result_of
          added.
        
      
      
        
          Test Library:
  
    namespace names gets shorten; old one still supported till next
      release
    added proper encoding of XML PCDATA
    support for wide string comparison implemented
  
  
    For complete list of changes see Test Library
    release notes.
  
        
      
    
  
  
    Regression tests
    
      This release has been extensively tested on a variety of different compilers
      and platforms. It is known to contain no regressions against the previous reference
      release on the compilers and configurations tested. Please refer to the corresponding
      regression
      reports to see how well your compiler performs on the new Boost codebase.

       Aleksey
      Gurtovoy managed this release. Managing
      a release at all is an enormous job, and Aleksey always goes beyond
      merely meeting requirements by insisting on the highest possible quality. The
      Boost membership owes him a debt of gratitude.
    
    
      This release wouldn't have been possible without the dedicated effort of many,
      many members of the Boost community who generously contributed their outstanding
      expertise, time and energy to making it happen. For patches, bug fixes, troubleshooting,
      expert advice, and prompt responses to the release manager's requests we thank:

      Software License, Eric Niebler and Joel de Guzman for taking on the
      important job of improving the Boost documentation's look and feel, and last,
      but not least, to our regression test runners, without whom we simply would
      never have released: Toon Knapen, Bronek Kozicki, Rene Rivera, Markus Schopflin,
