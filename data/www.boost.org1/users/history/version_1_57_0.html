                Fixed the kqueue reactor so that it works on FreeBSD
                (#10606).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed an issue in the kqueue reactor which resulted
                in spinning when using serial ports on Mac OS (#10496).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed kqueue reactor support for read-only file
                descriptors (#10367).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a compile error when using the /dev/poll
                reactor (#10350, #10572).
              
            
            
              
                Changed the Windows backend to use WSASocketW,
                as WSASocketA has
                been deprecated (#10534).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed some warnings reported by Visual C++ 2013 (#10376).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed integer type used in the WinRT version of the byte-order conversion
                functions (#10539).
              
            
            
              
                Changed documentation to indicate that use_future
                and spawn()
                are not made available when including the asio.hpp
                convenience header (#10567).
              
            
            
              
                Explicitly marked asio::strand
                as deprecated. Use asio::io_service::strand
                instead.

                flyweight default
                constructor was made explicit in Boost 1.56, which introduces a regression
                in some initialization scenarios. The former non-explicit default
                constructor has been restored (ticket #10439).

                Most components of the library were moved into the boost::iterators namespace. For backward
                compatibility the components are also accessible in the boost namespace.
              
            
            
              
                Iterator operators are now conditionally defined based on the iterator
                category.

                The next()
                and prior()
                functions taking distance arguments were reworked. The code now work
                correctly when the distance is unsigned or both arguments are integers.
                The new code relies on the availability of operators supported by
                the first argument to select the correct implementation.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          uBLAS:
          
            
              
                added two new types: matrix_row and matrix_column facades . With
                them, it is possible to access to the matrices as an array of rows
                and an array of columns, respectively.
              
            
            
              
                added fixed_vector/fixed_matrix classes to represent small - fixed
                size containers. Requires c++11 because it is using std::array
              
            
            
              
                fixed the long standing banded matrix bug (https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7549).
              
            
            
              
                the interface of matrices and vectors has been extended with cbegin,
                cend, crbegin and crend member functions, as defined in c++11.
              
            
            
              
                removed doxygen documentation to make the distribution lighter
              
            
            
              
                removed warnings with MSVC for unused parameters
              
            
            
              
                changed the uBlas development folder structure (will not affect users
                of the library)
              
            
            
              
                performed a very large overhaul with respect to warnings and errors
                on various compilers. Apart for some hard to resolve warnings and
                older compiler incompatibilities, compilations with uBlas will be
                much cleaner now.
