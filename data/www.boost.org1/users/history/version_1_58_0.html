    Known Issue
    
      
        
          Boost.Python will fail to build if it is compiled against a version of
          python that is one of: 3.0.X, 3.1.X, 3.2.X, 3.3.X. Versions 2.X and 3.4+
          are not affected. This is fixed in git.
        
      
      
        
          Boost.Fusion has a regression with non-constexpr types. #11211
  This
          is fixed in some PRs: Github

    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Ensured errors generated by Windows' ConnectEx
                function are mapped to their portable equivalents (#10744).
              
            
            
              
                Added new macro BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_CONNECTEX
                to allow use of ConnectEx
                to be explicitly disabled.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a race condition in windows::object_handle
                when there are pending wait operations on destruction (#10624).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed IPv6 address parsing on FreeBSD, where a trailing scope ID
                would cause conversion to fail with EINVAL.
              
            
            
              
                Worked around shared library visibility issues by ensuring Asio types
                use default visibility (#9465, #11070).
              
            
            
              
                Changed the SSL wrapper to call the password callback when loading
                an in-memory key (#10828).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed false SSL error reports by ensuring that the SSL error queue
                is cleared prior to each operation.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed an ssl::stream<>
                bug that may result in spurious 'short read' errors.
              
            
            
              
                Removed a redundant null pointer check in the SSL engine (#10088).
              
            
            
              
                Added options for disabling TLS v1.1 and v1.2 (#10690).
              
            
            
              
                Removed use of deprecated OpenSSL function ERR_remove_state.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed detection of various C++11 features with Clang (#8835,
                #10884).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed detection of C++11 std::addressof
                with g++ (#10982).
              
            
            
              
                Changed multicast test to treat certain join_group
                failures as non-fatal.
              
            
            
              
                Decoupled Asio unit tests from Boost.Test (#11116).
              
            
            
              
                Changed the tutorial to use std::endl
                to ensure output is flushed.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed an unsigned integer overflow reported by Clang's integer sanitizer.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for move-only return types when using a yield_context object with asynchronous
                operations.
              
            
            
              
                Changed yield_context
                to allow reentrant calls to the completion handler from an initiating
                function.
              
            
            
              
                Updated detection of Windows Runtime to work with latest Windows
                SDK.

                Massive dependency reorganization. Now Boost.Container
                depends on very basic utilities like Boost.Core and Boost.Intrusive.
                Preprocessed code size have decreased considerably and compilation
                times have improved.
              
            
            
              
                Added nth and index_of functions to containers

                are no longer ::boost::integral_constant<bool, true/false> types. The dependency reorganization
                needed to break with those classes to avoid MPL dependencies, and
                interoperability with std::integral_constant
                was not guaranteed. Code assumming boost::true_type/boost::false_type

          Functional/Factory:
          
            
              
                Minor breaking change: the default template parameter to indicate
                that it shouldn't use an allocator is now void,
                instead of boost::none_t.
                For details, see the changelog.

                      Bug in rtree constructors taking a pair of Iterators or a Range
                      (packing algorithm), the use of reference to destroyed temporary
                      when Iterator's reference is not true reference, e.g. for some
                      of the Range Adaptors. It also affects distance() and comparable_distance().
                      This bug may cause unexpected behavior of the rtree or distance()
                      algorithm, e.g. an assertion failure or a SEGFAULT.

                      not the same as value_type or indexable_type is passed. If
                      this happens, wrong result may be returned, in most cases 0.

          Multi-index Containers:
          
            
              
                The efficiency of lookup operations has improved in situations where
                they involve the generation of temporary values of key_type. Consider for instance
                the following code:
              
typedef multi_index_container<
  std::string,
  indexed_by<
    ordered_unique<identity<std::string> >
  >
> multi_t;
...
multi_t m=...;
m.find("boost"); // passed a const char*, not a std::string    
              
                In previous versions of the library, the find
                operation generates several temporary std::strings
                (one every time an internal comparison is made). In sufficiently
                advanced compilers, this is now avoided so that only one temporary
                is created.

                      boost::none_t is no longer convertible
                      from literal 0. This avoids a bug where optional<rational<int>> oi
                      = 0; would initialize an optional
                      object with no contained value.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Added a way to manually disable move semantics: just define
                      macro BOOST_OPTIONAL_CONFIG_NO_RVALUE_REFERENCES.
                      This can be used to work around #10399.

                Breaking change: Compile time checked
                getter is now used by default in boost::get<U>(VariantT) and boost::polymorphic_get<U>(VariantT). New getter asserts that type U is one of the types that can
                be stored in VariantT.
                Define BOOST_VARIANT_USE_RELAXED_GET_BY_DEFAULT
                to change default behavior. See get.hpp
