                Improved the algorithm for hashing floating point numbers.
              
            
            
              
                A few bug and warning fixes.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Iostreams: Framework
          for defining streams, stream buffers and i/o filters, from Jonathan Turkanis.
          Highlights:
          
            
              
                Clarified the semantics of close(). This fixes several bugs but will
                break some existing code. See Release
                Notes for details.
              
            
            
              
                Numerous other bug fixes and optimizations.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Multi Array:
          
            
              
                Added "dimensionality" compile-time constante to the MultiArray
                concept.
              
            
            
              
                For greater control over error situations, uses of C++ assert have
                been replaced with BOOST_ASSERT.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a bug with simultaneous resizing and reindexing.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Multi-index Containers:
          
            
              
                New global_fun predefined key
                extractor.
              
            
            
              
                Added iterator_to facility.
              
            
            
              
                Included support
                for non-standard allocators such as those of Boost.Interprocess,
                which makes multi_index_containers
                placeable in shared memory.
              
            
            
              
                New versions of modify
                and modify_key with
                rollback, as described in the tutorial.
              
            
            
              
                A number of optimizations and minor improvements have also been included.
                For a complete list of changes, see the library release
                notes.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Serialization:
   Boost.Serialization
          has been updated with optimizations for dense arrays.
        
      
      
        
          Thread:
          
            
              
                The Thread library has been updated to be more in line with the C++0x
                working draft.
              
            
            
              
                Instances of boost::thread and of the various lock types are now
                movable.
              
            
            
              
                Threads can be interrupted at interruption points.
              
            
            
              
                Condition variables can now be used with any type that implements
                the Lockable concept, through the use of boost::condition_variable_any
                (boost::condition is a typedef to boost::condition_variable_any, provided
                for backwards compatibility). boost::condition_variable
                is provided as an optimization, and will only work with boost::unique_lock<boost::mutex>
                (boost::mutex::scoped_lock).
              
            
            
              
                Thread IDs are separated from boost::thread, so a thread can obtain
                it's own ID (using boost::this_thread::get_id()), and IDs can be used as keys in
                associative containers, as they have the full set of comparison operators.
              
            
            
              
                Timeouts are now implemented using the Boost DateTime library, through
                a typedef boost::system_time for absolute timeouts,
                and with support for relative timeouts in many cases. boost::xtime is supported for backwards
                compatibility only.
              
            
            
              
                Locks are implemented as publicly accessible templates boost::lock_guard, boost::unique_lock,
                boost::shared_lock, and boost::upgrade_lock, which are templated
                on the type of the mutex. The Lockable concept has been extended
                to include publicly available lock() and unlock() member functions, which are used
                by the lock types.
              
            
            
              
                boost::try_mutex has been removed, and
                the functionality subsumed into boost::mutex.
                boost::try_mutex is left as a typedef,
                but is no longer a separate class.
              
            
            
              
                boost::recursive_try_mutex has been removed,
                and the functionality subsumed into boost::recursive_mutex.
                boost::recursive_try_mutex is left as
                a typedef, but is no longer a separate class.
              
            
            
              
                boost::detail::thread::lock_ops has been removed. Code
                that relies on the lock_ops
                implementation detail will no longer work, as this has been removed,
                as it is no longer necessary now that mutex types now have public
                lock()
                and unlock()
                member functions.
              
            
            
              
                scoped_lock constructors
                with a second parameter of type bool are no longer provided. With
                previous boost releases, boost::mutex::scoped_lock
                some_lock(some_mutex,false);
                could be used to create a lock object that was associated with a
                mutex, but did not lock it on construction. This facility has now
                been replaced with the constructor that takes a boost::defer_lock_type
                as the second parameter: boost::mutex::scoped_lock
                some_lock(some_mutex,boost::defer_lock);
              
            
            
              
                The broken boost::read_write_mutex
                has been replaced with boost::shared_mutex.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Wave: Standards conformant
          implementation of the mandated C99/C++ preprocessor functionality packed
          behind an easy to use iterator interface, from Hartmut Kaiser. Highlights:
          
            
              
                Added the possibility to continue the preprocessing after an error
                occured.
              
            
            
              
                Added the macro introspection API to the wave::context object.
              
            
            
              
                Added threading support to the library.
              
            
            
              
                Improved the overall performance by upto 30%.
              
            
            
              
                Changed and unified preprocessor hook interface (this is an interface
                breaking change!), added several new preprocessor hook functions.
              
            
            
              
                Added serialization support.
              
            
            
              
                Added new examples (for instance: Hannibal - a partial C++ parser,
                by Danny Havenith).
              
            
            
              
                Added a new lexical analyzer based on Ben Hansons Lexertl library.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a large number of other bugs and problems.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Xpressive: Regular
          expressions that can be written as strings or as expression templates,
          and that can refer to each other and themselves recursively with the power
          of context-free grammars, from Eric Niebler. Highlights:
          
            
              
                Added semantic actions to static regexes. A
                semantic action is code that executes when part of a regular expression
                matches.
              
            
            
              
                Added custom assertions to static regexes. A
                custom assertion is a Boolean predicate that can participate in the
                regex match.
              
            
            
              
                Added named regexes for embedding a static or
                dynamic regex into a dynamic regex. This can be used to create dynamic
                regex grammars.
              
            
            
              
                Added named captures to dynamic regexes, like
                Perl.
