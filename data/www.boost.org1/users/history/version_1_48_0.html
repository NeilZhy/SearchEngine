    Patches
    
      
        
          Locale
          Patch - Fixes a bug which causes boost::locale::utf::utf_traits
          to accept some invalid UTF-8 sequences, which is a possible security flaw.

    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Implemented various performance improvements, including:
                
                  
                    
                      Using thread-local operation queues in single-threaded use
                      cases (i.e. when concurrency_hint
                      is 1) to eliminate a lock/unlock pair.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Allowing some epoll_reactor
                      speculative operations to be performed without holding the
                      lock.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Improving locality of reference by performing an epoll_reactor's I/O operation
                      immediately before the corresponding handler is called. Also
                      improves scalability across CPUs.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Specialising asynchronous read and write operations for buffer
                      sequences that are arrays (boost::array
                      or std::array) of exactly two buffers.
                    
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                Fixed compile error in regex overload of async_read_until
                (#5688).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed Windows-specific compile error by explicitly specifying the
                signal()
                function from the global namespace (#5722).
              
            
            
              
                Changed deadline_timer
                implementation to not read clock unless the timer heap is non-empty.
              
            
            
              
                Changed SSL buffer sizes to be large enough to hold a complete TLS
                record (#5854).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed synchronous null_buffers
                operations so that they obey the user's non-blocking setting (#5756).
              
            
            
              
                Changed to set fd_set
                size at runtime when using Windows.
              
            
            
              
                Disabled MSVC warning due to const qualifier being applied to function
                type.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed crash that occurs when using Intel C++ compiler (#5763).
              
            
            
              
                Changed OpenSSL initialisation to support all available algorithms.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed SSL error mapping when session is gracefully shut down.
              
            
            
              
                Added some latency test programs.
              
            
            
              
                Clarified that a read operation ends when the buffer is full (#5999).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed exception safety issue in epoll_reactor
                initialisation (#6006).
              
            
            
              
                Made number of strand implementations configurable via BOOST_ASIO_STRAND_IMPLEMENTATIONS
                macro.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_SEQUENTIAL_STRAND_ALLOCATION
                flag which switches strand allocation to use a round-robin approach
                rather than hashing.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed potential strand starvation issue that can occur when strand.post()
                is used.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Chrono:
          
            
              
                #5979
                Added chrono rounding utilities as defined by Howard Hinnant here.
              
            
            
              
                #5978
                Add BOOST_CHRONO_HAS_PROCESS_CLOCKS to know if process clocks are
                available.
              
            
            
              
                #5998
                Make possible to disable hybrid error handling.
              
            
            
              
                #5906
                Take in account the constexpr as defined in the standard.
              
            
            
              
                #5907
                Take in account noexcept for compilers supporting it.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed some bugs.

                Make single_view
                a random access fusion sequence.

                      Robustness issue, in some circumstances the union failed to

                      Robustness issue, in some circumstances the calculated intersection
                      point was outside the segment. Fixed.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Concept issue, cartesian intersect didn't understand segments
                      other than the provided one. Fixed.

                      The fusion coordinate system was not registered correctly.

                      Checking self-intersections is now not done automatically,
                      this can blast performance.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Besides that, checking self-intersections is made faster.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Intersections now avoid outputting duplicate points. So they

                and Y functions. Also taken great care to avoid spurious over and
                underflow of these functions. Fixes issue #5560.

                Changed nextafter and related functions to behave in the same way
                as other implementations - so that nextafter(+INF, 0) is a finite
                value (issue #5832).

                Rewrite of internal transition tables. There were a few bugs (failing
                recursivity in internal transition tables of sub-sub machines) and
                a missing feature (unused internal transition table of the main state
                machine).

                      Fixed rare bugs causing multiple processing of the same event
                      in a submachine whose transition table contains this event
                      and a base event of it.

                Breaking change: the new internal transition table feature causes
                a minor breaking change. In a submachine, the "Fsm" template
                parameter for guards / actions of an internal table declared using
                internal_transition_table now is the submachine, not the higher-level
                state machine. Internal transitions declared using internal rows
                in the higher-level state machine keep their behavior (the "Fsm"
                parameter is the higher-level state machine). To sum up, the internal
                transition "Fsm" parameter is the closest state machine
                containing this transition.

                Breaking Change: Reduce numbers
                of operator overloads by using rvalue references on compilers that
                support them. Any user code that defines additional operator overloads
                on Proto expressions could potentially be rendered ambiguous by this
                change. The solution is to use a grammar to disable Proto's operators
                that are made ambiguous by any user-defined operators.
