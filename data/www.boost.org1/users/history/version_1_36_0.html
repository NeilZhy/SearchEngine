    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Added support for serial ports.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for UNIX domain sockets.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for raw sockets and ICMP.
              
            
            
              
                Added wrappers for POSIX stream-oriented file descriptors (excluding
                regular files).
              
            
            
              
                Added wrappers for Windows stream-oriented HANDLEs
                such as named pipes (requires HANDLEs
                that work with I/O completion ports).
              
            
            
              
                Added wrappers for Windows random-access HANDLEs
                such as files (requires HANDLEs
                that work with I/O completion ports).
              
            
            
              
                Added support for reactor-style operations (i.e. they report readiness
                but perform no I/O) using a new null_buffers
                type.
              
            
            
              
                Added an iterator type for bytewise traversal of buffer sequences.
              
            
            
              
                Added new read_until() and async_read_until() overloads that take a user-defined
                function object for locating message boundaries.
              
            
            
              
                Added an experimental two-lock queue (enabled by defining BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_TWO_LOCK_QUEUE)
                that may provide better io_service
                scalability across many processors.

          Assign:
  list_of()
          (and its variants) now has overloaded comparison operators. This allows
          you to write test code such as BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL( my_container, list_of(2)(3)(4)(5)
          );.
        
      
      
        
          Circular Buffer:
          
            
              
                Default constructor now doesn't allocate memory, and sets the capacity
                of the buffer to 0
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Foreach: BOOST_FOREACH macro for easily iterating
          over the elements of a sequence, from Eric Niebler.
          
            
              
                New BOOST_REVERSE_FOREACH
                macro for iterating over a sequence in reverse.

                Improved allocator support, from Emil Dotchevski.

                shared_ptr is movable

                Implementation changed to avoid explicit use of try-catch blocks and be compilable with
                exceptions disabled.

                A few bugs fixed and missing functions added (including the serious
                win32 condition variable bug).

          Wave:
          
            
              
                Wave V2.0 is a new major release introducing some breaking API changes,
                preventing it to be used with Boost versions earlier than V1.36.0.
                Mainly, the API and hook interface have been streamlined for more
                consistency.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a couple of bugs, improved regression test system to include
                testing of the preporcessing hooks interface (for details see: Changelog).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Xpressive:
  Regular
          expressions that can be written as strings or as expression templates,
          and that can refer to each other and themselves recursively with the power
          of context-free grammars, from Eric Niebler.
          
            
              
                skip()
                for specifying which parts of the input sequence to ignore when matching
                it against a regex.
              
            
            
              
                regex_replace()
                accepts formatter objects and formatter expressions in addition to
                format strings.
              
            
            
              
                Range-based regex_replace() algorithm.
              
            
            
              
                Fix crash when semantic actions are placed in look-aheads, look-behinds
                or independent sub-expressions.
