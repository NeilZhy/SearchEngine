        Boost Build System: Continued
        improvements.
      
    
    
      
        Config Library: Continued
        refinements.
      
    
    
      
        Graph Library: Final
        cleanup for upcoming the Boost Graph Library book.
      
    
    
      
        Thread Library: Minor
        fixes - tests now pass on most Win32 and POSIX systems including Linux and
        Solaris. Semaphore removed as too error prone.
      
    
    
      
        Function Library: direct
        support for member function pointers and documentation updates.
