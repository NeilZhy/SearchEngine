        Iterator Adaptor
        Library added. Adapt a base type into a standard conforming iterator,
        and more, from Dave Abrahams, Jeremy Siek, and John Potter.
      
    
    
      
        Pool Library added.
        Memory pool management from Steve Cleary.
      
    
    
      
        Test Library added.
        Support for program testing and execution from Beman Dawes.
      
    
    
      
        Generic Programming Techniques
        page added, contributed by Dave Abrahams.
      
    
    
      
        Graph Library:
  Updated
        use of iterator adaptors. Changed operator
        == for adjacency_list::edge_descriptor
        to improve semantics for multigraphs. Moved adjacency_iterator_generator
        from namespace detail to
        boost and added documentation.
        Renamed dynamic_components() to incremental_components(),
        better matching graph literature terminology. Cleaned up interface of connected_components() and created separate strong_components()
        function using Tarjan's more efficient algorithm. Fixed documentation figures
        for adjacency_list
        and adjacency_matrix.
        Added docs for cuthill_mckee_ordering()
        algorithm.
      
    
    
      
        Python Library upgraded.
        Better compatibility with Python 2.0, NULL pointers and smart-pointers get
        converted to/from python None, massive documentation review/revision.
      
    
    
      
        Regular Expression Library: Minor
        fixes for Unicode platforms.
      
    
    
      
        Type Traits Library
  upgraded:
        Major revision.
