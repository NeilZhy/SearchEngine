  Process library by Klemens
          D. Morgenstern, that provides cross platorm ways to allows you to:
        
        
          
            
              create child processes
            
          
          
            
              setup streams for child processes
            
          
          
            
              communicate with child processes through streams (synchronously or
              asynchronously)
            
          
          
            
              wait for processes to exit (synchronously or asynchronously)
            
          
          
            
              terminate processes

                and SFINAE expressions (Glen Fernandes). BOOST_CORE_NO_CONSTEXPR_ADDRESSOF
                macro indicates when constexpr
