    New Libraries
    
      
        
          Meta State Machine:
  High-performance
          expressive UML2 finite state machines, from Christophe Henry
        
      
      
        
          Polygon:
  Booleans/clipping,
          resizing/offsetting and more for planar polygons with integral coordinates,
          from Lucanus Simonson.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Accumulators:
          
            
              
                Correct miscellaneous documentation inaccuracies
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Reduced compile times. (Note that some programs may need to add additional
                #includes, e.g.
                if the program uses boost::array
                but does not explicitly include <boost/array.hpp>.)
              
            
            
              
                Reduced the size of generated code.
              
            
            
              
                Refactored deadline_timer
                implementation to improve performance.
              
            
            
              
                Improved multiprocessor scalability on Windows by using a dedicated
                hidden thread to wait for timers.
              
            
            
              
                Improved performance of asio::streambuf
                with async_read()
                and async_read_until(). These read operations now use
                the existing capacity of the streambuf
                when reading, rather than limiting the read to 512 bytes.
              
            
            
              
                Added optional separate compilation. To enable, add #include <boost/asio/impl/src.cpp>
                to one source file in a program, then build the program with BOOST_ASIO_SEPARATE_COMPILATION
                defined in the project/compiler settings. Alternatively, BOOST_ASIO_DYN_LINK may be defined
                to build a separately-compiled Asio as part of a shared library.
              
            
            
              
                Added new macro BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_FENCED_BLOCK
                to permit the disabling of memory fences around completion handlers,
                even if thread support is enabled.
              
            
            
              
                Reworked timeout examples to better illustrate typical use cases.
              
            
            
              
                Ensured that handler arguments are passed as const
                types.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed incorrect parameter order in null_buffers
                variant of async_send_to
                (#4170).
              
            
            
              
                Ensured unsigned char
                is used with isdigit
                in getaddrinfo emulation
                (#4201).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed handling of very small but non-zero timeouts (#4205).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed crash that occurred when an empty buffer sequence was passed
                to a composed read or write operation.
              
            
            
              
                Added missing operator+ overload in buffers_iterator
                (#4382).
              
            
            
              
                Implemented cancellation of null_buffers
                operations on Windows.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Config:
          
            
              
                Added new defect macro, BOOST_NO_COMPLETE_VALUE_INITIALIZATION.
              
            
            
              
                Added new defect macro BOOST_NO_0X_HDR_TYPEINDEX,
                fixes issue #4274.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for code visibility in GCC.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed issues #4385,
                #4324,
                #4221,
                #4182,

                #4012.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Filesystem:
          
            
              
                This release contains both version 2 and version 3 of the library.
                Version 3 is a major upgrade that will break some existing user code,
                so version 2 is the default. Users are encouraged to migrate to version
                3. See 'Version 2'
                and 'Version 3'
                for more information.
              
            
            
              
                Fix problems with symbol visibility for shared libraries.
              
            
            
              
                Fix various minor problems.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed issues: #3863,
                #4248.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Foreach:
          
            
              
                Add boost/foreach_fwd.hpp for forward declarations of
                foreach's customization points, fixes #3998.
              
            
            
              
                Remove out-of-date work-arounds for sun compilers, fixes #4306.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Fusion:
          
            
              
                Added fusion::reverse_fold, fusion::iter_fold
                and fusion::reverse_iter_fold (#1623).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Hash:
          
            
              
                Option to prevent implicit casts when calling the hash function by
                defining the macro BOOST_HASH_NO_IMPLICIT_CASTS,
                which can avoid some subtle problems. This might be activated by
                default in a future version.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Iostreams:
          
            
              
                Several fixes for file descriptors class, including a breaking change
                to the constructors and open
                methods for file_descriptor,
                file_descriptor_source
                and file_descriptor_sink.
                See the
                documentation for details. The old methods are still available
                if you define BOOST_IOSTREAMS_USE_DEPRECATED
                (#3323,
                #3517,
                #4335).
              
            
            
              
                Fix several issues with compression and decompression (#2318,
                #4091,
                #3348,
                #2783,
                #1579,
                #3853).
              
            
            
              
                And a load more miscellaneous fixes (#3851,
                #3279,
                #3689,
                #2356,
                #2996,
                #4102,
                #2998,
                #1612,
                #2325).
              
            
            
              
                Thanks to Steven Watanabe for almost all these fixes. For more detail
                see the release
                notes.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Math:
          
            
              
                Fixed incorrect range and support for Rayleigh distribution.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          MPL:
          
            
              
                Make mpl::string work with mpl::transform.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Multi-index Containers:
          
            
              
                Fixed a bug preventing the use of modify_key
                with rollback in ordered
                and hashed
                indices when Modifier
                and Rollback are
                different types (ticket #4130).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Proto:
          
            
              
                Minor change in behavior: when using
                proto::and_ as a transform, apply all
                transforms but only return the result of applying the last. See Proto's
                Release
                Notes for details.
              
            
            
              
                Minor change in behavior: proto::as_expr and proto::as_child
                no longer run objects that are already proto expressions through
                the expression domain's generator. See Proto's Release
                Notes for details.
              
            
            
              
                Minor change in behavior: Proto
                uses proto::basic_expr instead of proto::expr when possible for better compile
                times. See Proto's Release
                Notes for details.
              
            
            
              
                Add support for sub-domains.
              
            
            
              
                Introduce per-domain as_expr
                and as_child customization
                points to allow for domain-specific customization of variable capture
                behavior.
              
            
            
              
                The proto::_default transform is also a grammar
                that matches the expressions the transform knows how to handle.
              
            
            
              
                Add proto::_void, a no-op primitive transform
                that does nothing and returns void.
              
            
            
              
                The proto::pass_through transform doesn't
                strip expression wrappers, fixes #4175.
              
            
            
              
                Const-correctness fixes when invoking proto domains.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Regex:
          
            
              
                Fixed issues: #4309,
                #4215,
                #4212,
                #4191,

          Spirit:
  Spirit V2.4,

          New' section for details.
        
      
      
        
          System:
          
            
              
                Change system_category and generic_category to functions, to conform
                to the C++0x FCD. This change may cause compile errors some user
