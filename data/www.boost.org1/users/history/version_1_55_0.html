    News
    
      Support was removed from Config for some
      very old versions of compilers. The new minimum requirements are:
    
    
      
        
          Digitial Mars 8.41
        
      
      
        
          GCC 3.3
        
      
      
        
          Intel 6.0
        
      
      
        
          Visual C++ 7.1
        
      
    
    
      Note: This is just the mininimum requirements
      for Config. Some Boost libraries may have higher mininimum requirements and
      not support all platforms or compilers.
    
    
      Other compilers are currently unchanged, but we are considering removing support
      for some other old compilers. Candidates for
      removal are:
    
    
      
        
          Metroworks C++ (i.e. codewarrior)
        
      
      
        
          SunPro 5.7 and earlier
        
      
      
        
          Borland C++ Builder 2006 (5.82) and earlier
        
      
    
    
      If you're using any of these, please let us know on the mailing lists. We will
      take into account any feedback received before making a decision.
    
  
  
    Known Bugs with Visual Studio
    2013/Visual C++ 12
    
      Visual Studio 2013 was released quite late in the release process, so there
      exist several unresolved issues. These include:
    
    
      
        
          Serialization can't compile because of a missing include.
        
      
      
        
          Using has_member_function_callable_with
          from Boost.Container's allocator_traits
          causes a compile error (#9332).
        
      
      
        
          In libraries such as Unordered and MultiIndex, calling overloaded functions
          with initializer lists can result in a compile error, with Visual C++ claiming
          that the overloads are ambiguous. This is a Visual C++ bug and it isn't
          clear if there's a good workaround. This won't affect code that doesn't
          use initializer lists, or uses an initializer list that doesn't require
          an implicit conversion (i.e. an initializer list of the container's exact
          value type).
        
      
      
        
          Thread: ex_scoped_thread
          compile fails (#9333).
        
      
    
  
  
    Patches
    
      
        
          Log patch:
          fixes incorrect output of the dump
          manipulator, when used on AVX2-enabled CPU (e.g. Intel Haswell).
        
      
    
  
  
    New Libraries
    
      
        
          Predef: This library defines a
          set of compiler, architecture, operating system, library, and other version
          numbers from the information it can gather of C, C++, Objective C, and
          Objective C++ predefined macros or those defined in generally available
          headers, from Rene Rivera.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Accumulators:
          
            
              
                #7915 Fix silly typos.
              
            
            
              
                #8850 Fix MSVC warnings.
              
            
            
              
                #8262 Rename average
                to fdiv.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Any:
          
            
              
                boost::bad_any_cast exception is now visible
                across modules #8751.
              
            
            
              
                Added clear()
                member function.
              
            
            
              
                Added missing BOOST_NOEXCEPT.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed issue with const rvalues #9215.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Implemented a limited port to Windows Runtime. This support requires
                that the language extensions be enabled. Due to the restricted facilities
                exposed by the Windows Runtime API, the port also comes with the
                following caveats:
                
                  
                    
                      The core facilities such as the io_service,
                      strand, buffers,
                      composed operations, timers, etc., should all work as normal.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      For sockets, only client-side TCP is supported.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Explicit binding of a client-side TCP socket is not supported.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      The cancel() function is not supported
                      for sockets. Asynchronous operations may only be cancelled
                      by closing the socket.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Operations that use null_buffers
                      are not supported.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Only tcp::no_delay and socket_base::keep_alive options are supported.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Resolvers do not support service names, only numbers. I.e.
                      you must use "80" rather than "http".
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Most resolver query flags have no effect.
                    
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a regression (introduced in Boost 1.54) where, on some platforms,
                errors from async_connect
                were not correctly propagated through to the completion handler (#8795).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a Windows-specific regression (introduced in Boost 1.54) that
                occurs when multiple threads are running an io_service.
                When the bug occurs, the result of an asynchronous operation (error
                and bytes transferred) is incorrectly discarded and zero values used
                instead. For TCP sockets this results in spurious end-of-file notifications
                (#8933).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a bug in handler tracking, where it was not correctly printing
                out some handler IDs (#8808).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed the comparison used to test for successful synchronous accept
                operations so that it works correctly with unsigned socket descriptors
                (#8752).
              
            
            
              
                Ensured the signal number is correctly passed to the completion handler
                when starting an async_wait
                on a signal that is already raised (#8738).
              
            
            
              
                Suppressed a g++ 4.8+ warning about unused typedefs (#8980).
              
            
            
              
                Enabled the move optimisation for handlers that use the default invocation
                hook (#8624).
              
            
            
              
                Clarified that programs must not issue overlapping async_write_at operations (#8669).
              
            
            
              
                Changed the Windows HANDLE
                backend to treat ERROR_MORE_DATA
                as a non-fatal error when returned by GetOverlappedResult
                for a synchronous read (#8722).
              
            
            
              
                Visual C++ language extensions use generic
                as a keyword. Added a workaround that renames the namespace to cpp_generic when those language
                extensions are in effect.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed some asynchronous operations that missed out on getting async_result support in Boost 1.54.
                In particular, the buffered stream templates have been updated so
                that they adhere to current handler patterns (#9000, #9001).
              
            
            
              
                Enabled move support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 (#8959).
              
            
            
              
                Added use_future
                support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.
              
            
            
              
                Removed a use of std::min
                in the Windows IOCP backend to avoid a dependency on the <algorithm> header (#8758).
              
            
            
              
                Eliminated some unnecessary handler copies.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed various minor and cosmetic issues in code and documentation
                (including #8347, #8950, #8953, #8965, #8997).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Atomic:
          
            
              
                Added support for 64-bit atomic operations on x86 target for GCC,
                MSVC and compatible compilers. The support is enabled when it is
                known at compile time that the target CPU supports required instructions.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for 128-bit atomic operations on x86-64 target for
                GCC and compatible compilers. The support is enabled when it is known
                at compile time that the target CPU supports required instructions.
                The support can be tested for with the new BOOST_ATOMIC_INT128_LOCK_FREE
                macro.
              
            
            
              
                Added a more efficient implementation of atomic<> based on GCC __atomic*
                intrinsics available since GCC 4.7.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for more ARM v7 CPUs, improved detection of Thumb 2.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for x32 (i.e. 64-bit x86 with 32-bit pointers) target
                on GCC and compatible compilers.
              
            
            
              
                Removed dependency on Boost.Thread.
              
            
            
              
                Internal lock pool now includes proper padding and alignment to avoid
                false sharing.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed compilation with Intel compiler on Windows. Removed internal
                macro duplication when compiled on Windows.
              
            
            
              
                Some code refactoring to use C++11 features when available.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Chrono:
          
            
              
                Fixed Bugs:
                
                  
                    
                      #7868
                      chrono_io parses

          Circular Buffer:
          
            
              
                Added support for rvalue references and rvalue references emulation

                      By defining this macro the user can disable compilation of
                      the default filter and formatter factories used by settings
                      parsers. This can substantially reduce binary sizes while still
                      retaining support for settings parsers.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Rewritten some of the parsers to reduce the compiled binary
                      size. The rewritten parsers are more robust in detecting ambiguous
                      and incorrect input.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      The following headers are deprecated: boost/log/utility/intrusive_ref_counter.hpp,
                      boost/log/utility/explicit_operator_bool.hpp, boost/log/utility/empty_deleter.hpp.
                      These headers will be removed in future releases. The contents
                      of these headers were moved to other libraries.
                    
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                Bug fixes:
                
                  
                    
                      Fixed timer
                      attribute generating incorrect time readings on Windows on
                      heavy thread contention when QueryPerformanceCounter
                      API was used.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Fixed a bug in the filter parser that prevented using parsed
                      filters with some attributes.

          Multi-index Containers:
          
            
              
                Boost.MultiIndex has been brought to a higher level of compliance
                with C++11.

                    Non-copyable elements (such as std::unique_ptr<T>) supported. This includes
                    insertion of a range [first,last) where the iterators point
                    to a type that is convertible to that of the element: no copy
                    construction happens in the process.

                Bugs fixed from Trac: #8197.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          PropertyMap:
          
            
              
                dynamic_properties objects can now be built by non-destructively
                chaining .property(name, pm) calls. Example:
              
boost::dynamic_properties()
  .property("color", color_map)
  .property("pos", position_map)
            
            
              
                The use of raw pointers as property maps is deprecated; it often
                failed on Visual Studio in the past. This usage has been removed
                from all tests and examples in Boost.Graph. The replacement to use
                for vertex properties in graphs (the most common use for this feature)
                is:
              
boost::make_iterator_property_map(
  <pointer or container .begin() iterator>,
  get(boost::vertex_index, <graph object>))
              
                (Note: the lack of namespace qualification on get() in this code
                is necessary for generic code). Outside a graph context, the closest
                equivalent is:
              
boost::make_iterator_property_map(
  <pointer>,
  boost::typed_identity_property_map<std::size_t>())
              
                There are commented-out static assertions on lines 151 and 159 of
                <boost/property_map/property_map.hpp> that can be un-commented to find
                deprecated uses of pointers in user code.

                Added lowest and
                max_digits10, members
                of std::numeric_limits added in C++11, to the unit-test code. Needed
                since Boost.Test refers to one of them when compiled in C++11 mode.
              
            
            
              
                Changed initialization of some internal variables to something that
                cannot be a narrowing conversion, which fixes issue #5855. Needed

                Added boost/smart_ptr/intrusive_ref_counter.hpp header, extracted from Boost.Log.
                The header implements a mixin base class that adds support for intrusive_ptr to user's classes.

                Work around variadic parameter bug in Visual Studio 2013. The compiler
                still has problems with initializer lists, but it might not be possible
                to work around those.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Utility:
          
            
              
                boost::result_of can be set to use TR1
                protocol by default and fall back to decltype
                if the function object does not support it (like C++11 lambda functions,
                for example). Define BOOST_RESULT_OF_USE_TR1_WITH_DECLTYPE_FALLBACK
                configuration macro to enable this mode.
              
            
            
              
                Improved support for C++11 in the boost::base_from_member
                class template. The class implements perfect forwarding for the constructor
                arguments, if the compiler supports rvalue references, variadic templates
                and function template default arguments.
              
            
            
              
                Added boost/utility/explicit_operator_bool.hpp and boost/utility/empty_deleter.hpp
                headers, which were extracted from Boost.Log. The headers implement
                utilities for defining explicit conversion operators to bool and a deleter function object
                that does nothing, respectively.
