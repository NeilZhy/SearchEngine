    14 Dec 1999
    
      Operators.hpp documentation
      improved.
    
  
  
    13 Dec 1999
    
      Added iterator operators and helpers to header
      operators.hpp, together with an iterator test program. This header
      is maturing into something really useful for building arithmetic or iterator
      user-defined types, so look it over even if you browsed one of the earlier
      versions.
    
  
  
    11 Dec 1999
    
      Added next() and prior() to header utility.hpp.
    
  
  
    8 Dec 1999
    
      Minor improvements to the smart pointer
      library: operator ==,
      operator !=,
      and specializations for std::swap and
      std::less now provided.
    
  
  
    18 Nov 1999
    
      Minor improvements made to the Operator
      templates.
    
  
  
    15 Nov 1999
    
      Operator templates have been
      added to the utility library.
    
  
  
    11 Oct 1999
    
      Minor smart pointer library
      and config.hpp changes to improve portability.
    
  
  
    26 Sep 1999
    
      Minor updates to several libraries: * polymorphic_downcast<> in the utility
      library cast.hpp header now works for
      multiple inheritance cases. * shared_ptr<> and shared_array<> swap() functions added in the smart
      pointer library. * timer.hpp elapsed_max()
      and elapsed_min()
      functions added to the timer library.
      * integer library bin_ubin.hpp
      changes to eliminate compiler warning messages. * config.hpp
      minor changes to aid library developers. No impact on library users.
    
  
  
    3 Sep 1999
    
      The cast functions in the utility
      library were considerably simplified.
    
  
  
    1 Sep 1999
    
      The cast functions initially in utility.hpp
      have been moved to cast.hpp, still in
      the utility library.
    
  
  
    1 Sep 1999
    
      The category "Experimental" has been added to the library
      page. The integer library is
      the first entry.
    
  
  
    ...And the remainder are lost to the mists of time (for now, anyway)....
