                Updated documentation to show rvalue-references functions instead
                of emulation functions.

                Several bugfixes (#2391,

          Intrusive:
          
            
              
                New treap-based containers: treap, treap_set, treap_multiset.

          Lexical Cast:
          
            
              
                Changed to work without RTTI when BOOST_NO_TYPEID
                is defined (#1220).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Math:
          
            
              
                Added Johan Råde's optimised floating point classification routines.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed code so that it compiles in GCC's -pedantic mode (bug report
                #1451).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Multi-index Containers:
  Some
          redundant type definitions have been deprecated. Consult the library release notes

          Proto:
          
            
              
                Fix problem with SFINAE of binary operators (Bug 2407).
              
            
            
              
                Fix proto::call transform for callable transforms
                with >3 arguments.
              
            
            
              
                result_of::value changed behavior for array-by-value
                terminals.
              
            
            
              
                unpack_expr requires
                only Forward Sequences rather than Random Access Sequences.
              
            
            
              
                Deprecate legacy undocumented BOOST_PROTO_DEFINE_(VARARG_)FUNCTION_TEMPLATE
                macros.
              
            
            
              
                Add BOOST_PROTO_REPEAT
                and BOOST_PROTO_LOCAL_ITERATE
                macros to help with repetitive code generation
              
            
            
              
                Support for nullary expressions with tag types other than proto::tag::terminal
              
            
            
              
                Allow 0- and 1-argument variants of proto::or_
                and proto::and_
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Regex:
          
            
              
                Breaking change: empty expressions, and empty
                alternatives are now allowed when using the Perl regular expression
                syntax. This change has been added for Perl compatibility, when the
                new syntax_option_type
                no_empty_expressions is set then the old behaviour
                is preserved and empty expressions are prohibited. This is issue
                #1081.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for Perl style ${n} expressions in format strings (issue
                #2556).
              
            
            
              
                Added support for accessing the location of sub-expressions within
                the regular expression string (issue #2269).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed compiler compatibility issues #2244,
                #2514,
                and #2458.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Thread:
          
            
              
                No longer catches unhandled exceptions in threads as this debuggers
                couldn't identify the cause of unhandled exceptions in threads. An
                unhandled exception will still cause the application to terminate.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          TR1:
          
            
              
                Added support for the TR1 math functions and the unordered containers.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Type Traits:
          
            
              
                Added support for Codegear intrinsics.
              
            
            
              
                Minor tweaks to warning suppression and alignment_of code.

                Use boost::swap.
              
            
            
              
                Use a larger prime number list for selecting the number of buckets.
              
            
            
              
                Use aligned
                storage to store the types.
              
            
            
              
                Add support for C++0x initializer lists where they're available.

                basic_regex gets
                nested syntax_option_flags
                and value_type typedef,
                for compatibility with std::basic_regex

                has been removed.
              
            
            
              
                regex_error inherits

    Other Changes
    
      
        
          Experimental support for building Boost with CMake
          has been introduced in this version. For more details see the wiki,
          Discussion is taking place on the Boost-cmake
          mailing list.
        
      
      
        
          Fixed subversion properties for several files. Most notably, unix shell
          scripts should always have unix line endings, even in the windows packages.
