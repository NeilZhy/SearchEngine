    New License
    
      A unified Boost Software
      License has been developed and will gradually replace the individual
      licenses for most Boost libraries. The new license offers better legal protection
      for both users and developers, and should speed user's legal reviews of Boost
      libraries. Dave Abrahams led the Boost effort to develop better licensing.
      The legal team was led by Diane
      Cabell, Director, Clinical Programs, Berkman
      Center for Internet & Society, Harvard Law School. Devin
      Smith, attorney, Nixon
      Peabody LLP, wrote the Boost License. Eva Chan, Harvard Law School,
      contributed analysis of issues and drafts of various legal documents.
    
    
      Note: Many of the Boost libraries are still using earlier licenses, though
      all conform to the Boost
      License Requirements. After this release we will begin an effort to
      move toward uniform use of the new license.
    
  
  
    Build and Installation
    
      
        
          New Getting Started
          procedures ease download and installation, from Rene Rivera and others.
        
      
      
        
          Improved support for libraries requiring separate
          compilation, from John Maddock and others.
        
      
    
  
  
    New Libraries
    
      
        
          enable_if: Selective
          inclusion of function template overloads, from Jaakko Jarvi, Jeremiah Willcock,
          and Andrew Lumsdaine. This is an important new technique which exploits
          the SFINAE (substitution-failure-is-not-an-error) principle.
        
      
      
        
          Variant Library: Safe,
          generic, stack-based discriminated union container, from Eric Friedman
          and Itay Maman.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Compose: This
          library has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use
          Bind or Lambda instead.
        
      
      
        
          Date
          Time Library: A whole host of bug fixes, new features, and documentation
          improvements. See the Date Time Change History for details.
        
      
      
        
          Filesystem
          Library:
  Several added functions, including improved checking for
          directory and file name portability.
        
      
      
        
          Iterator
          Library: Major version upgrade, with interface as proposed for the
          C++ library TR, including an improved iterator_adaptor
          design plus several new components, from David Abrahams, Jeremy Siek, and
          Thomas Witt.
        
      
      
        
          MultiArray: The
          multi_array class template now provides an element-preserving
          resize operation as well as default construction (see the reference
          manual for more information).
        
      
      
        
          Python Library:
          
            
              
                Support for Python 2.3 and Intel C++ on Linux
              
            
            
              
                Container Indexing
                Suite added.
              
            
            
              
                injected constructors and wrapped function objects.
              
            
            
              
                wrapping static data members.
              
            
            
              
                std::wstring conversions.
              
            
            
              
                Improved keyword
                arguments.
              
            
            
              
                Better error messages, including name demangling for GCC.
              
            
            
              
                Simpler build
                procedure.
              
            
            
              
                ...and more....
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Random Number
          Library: Interface changed to match the C++ TR
          proposal, from Jens Maurer.
        
      
      
        
          Regex: Completely
          new matching algorithm is now much faster than before, plus a selection
          of new features
          and enhancements.
        
      
      
        
          Boost.Spirit
          1.8.0:
  
    Multiple grammar start rules
    Multiple Scanner rules (no more scanner business woes)
    More dynamic parsers
    Predefined actors
    Numerous bug fixes and QOI stuff
    and more...
  
  
    Starting from Spirit v1.8.0, ill conforming compilers will no longer be
    supported. If you are still using one of these older compilers, please use
    Spirit v1.6.x. See [@http://spirit.sf.net Spirit's Site] for more details.
  
        
      
      
        
          Test Library:
  
    Free function template based test case
    Custom exception translators support in execution monitor and
    register_exception_translator added for unit test framework
    Added support for multi-module unit tests in automatic
    registration facility
    Floating point comparison algorithm reworked (Is not backward
    compatible!!!)
    Added support for custom users predicate returning both boolean
    result code and possibly error message
    Documentation structure rework and update
  
  
    For a complete list of changes see the Test Library
    release notes.
  
        
      
    
  
  
    Miscellaneous
