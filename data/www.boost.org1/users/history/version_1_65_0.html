    Known Issues
    
      These are patches from library authors which were found too late to be fixed
      in the release. Be careful as they have not been through the normal testing
      process.
    
    
      Combined patch for fixes to issues: boost_1_65_0.patch.
      Use patch -p1 < boost_1_65_0.patch from the root of the boost repo to
      apply. Or you can apply the patches individually below.

                Note: Library has issue
                with MinGW and may produce empty backtraces with that compiler.

                Changed to require g++ versions >= 4.7 to use
                standard atomics, to fix a linker error when using g++
                4.6 (#13121).
              
            
            
              
                Enabled use of constexpr

                Fixed a race condition in the Linux epoll backend, which may occur
                when a socket or descriptor is closed while another thread is blocked
                on epoll.
              
            
            
              
                Eliminated use of deprecated auto_ptr.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed misplaced use of asio_handler_is_continuation
                result in reactive async_accept
                implementation.
              
            
            
              
                Changed to use poll.h
                rather than sys/poll.h on some modern POSIX platforms
                (#12419).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed MSVC intellisense detection.
              
            
            
              
                Disabled use of the __thread
                keyword extension for android/clang/x86 targets.

                Parsing of implicit options can now use the value from the next token.
                Since 1.59, unless the value of implicit option was specified in
                the same token as the option itself, the implicit value was used.
                That proved inconvenient, and now we again check the next token and
                use it as value if it's not an option itself. (#25)
