    New Libraries
    
      
        
          VMD:
  Variadic Macro Data library,
          from Edward Diener.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Atomic:
          
            
              
                Enforced proper alignment of atomic<> storage. This should fix
                possible issues on platforms that support atomic operations on data
                units larger than the native word size. This may also change binary
                layout of user's data structures that have atomic<> members.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed compilation for PowerPC with IBM XL C++ compiler. Corrected
                memory barriers in PowerPC assembler.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed compilation with MSVC-8 for ARM.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed compilation with gcc 4.4 for x86-64, when 128-bit atomic operations
                were used. (#10994)
              
            
            
              
                Optimized some gcc assembler blocks for x86/x86-64 to reduce the
                number of used registers. This may require binutils 2.10 or later.

                      file sink backend, when the file name contains date/time placeholders.

      Notes for
      Windows users
      
        This release of Boost will by default compile for Windows Vista/Windows Server
        2008, if the compiler supports a recent enough Windows SDK, and for Windows
        XP otherwise. Binaries compiled with default options may not run on the older
        Windows versions.
      
      
        It is still possible to explicitly specify target Windows version by defining
        BOOST_USE_WINAPI_VERSION
        to a numeric version of Windows API. For example, building Boost for Windows
        XP can be done with the following command:
      
    b2 release define=BOOST_USE_WINAPI_VERSION=0x0501
      
        The list of Windows API version numbers can be seen on this
        page.
      
      
        This change only concerns libraries that use the common Windows API abstraction
        layer. Currently, these libraries are: Boost.Chrono, Boost.Dll, Boost.Log,
        Boost.UUID. This will also affect all dependent libraries.
      
    
    
      Release
      of Hana postponed
      
        Due to time constraints, the release of Hana
        will be postponed to a later release of Boost. This will also allow some
        known issues to be addressed properly before releasing the library officially
        as a part of Boost. More information can be found on the mailing
        list.
      
    
    
      Release
      of Boost.DLL library postponed
      
        In order to provide superior support of uncommon toolsets and platforms,
        the release of Boost.DLL was postponed to a later release of Boost. This
        also allows to test better a recently added ability to copy construct and
        copy assign instances of boost::dll::shared_library and provide examples on
        importing functions with non default calling conventions. Latest version
        and developer documentation of the library could be found at GitHub
        repo.
