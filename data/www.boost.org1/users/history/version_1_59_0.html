    Known Issue
    
      
        
          Boost.Log contains has a regression that prevents some of the logging statements
          from compiling (#11549). This is fixed in git.

                Add a new concept, Unbounded
                Sequence for sequence and
                Unbounded Iterator
                for iterator. Currently, Unbounded
                Sequence affects the behaviour
                of fusion::(value_)at(_c)
                and fusion::(value_)at_key. Unbounded
                Iterator has no effect
                (reserved for future release). For more details, see Unbounded
                Sequence and Unbounded

                      On systems with symbol
                      visibility support (e.g. Linux) the library is now
                      built with all internal symbols hidden.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Breaking change: The library
                      has been ported to Boost.TypeIndex for its underlying type
                      info management tool. This affected the following public interfaces:
                      
                        
                          
                            invalid_type
                            exceptions thrown by the library now have typeindex::type_index attached
                            as the description of the offending type. The type was
                            previously identified by type_info_wrapper.
                          
                        
                        
                          
                            Boost.Exception type_info_info
                            error information now contains typeindex::type_index
                            instead of type_info_wrapper.
                          
                        
                        
                          
                            attribute_value::get_type() now returns typeindex::type_index instead
                            of type_info_wrapper.
                            User-defined attribute value implementations should be
                            similarly changed (the attribute_value::impl::get_type() virtual method now
                            also returns typeindex::type_index).

                These features were non-standard extensions of the old parser but
                their removal could break code which was relying on them.
