    Supported Compilers
    
      Boost is tested on a wide range of compilers and platforms. Since Boost libraries
      rely on modern C++ features not available in all compilers, not all Boost libraries
      will work with every compiler. The following compilers and platforms have been
      extensively tested with Boost, although many other compilers and platforms
      will work as well. For more information, see the regression
      test results.
    
    
      New for this release: Support for building with the newest
      STLport-5.0 was added. The support includes building with MinGW Runtime 3.8
      plus STLport-5.0 improved to support wide character operations. Apple GCC 4.0,
      HP Tru64 C++, and Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 are supported platforms. We have
      added an experimental autoconf-like configure script for
      Unix-like systems: run configure --help for more information.
    
    
      
        
          Apple GCC 3.3, 4.0 on
          Mac OS X.
        
      
      
        
          Borland C++
          5.6.4 on Windows.
        
      
      
        
          GNU C++ 2.95.3 (with and without
          STLport), 3.2.x., 3.3.x, 3.4.x, 4.0.x on Windows, Linux and Solaris.
        
      
      
        
          HP C++ for Tru64 UNIX 7.1.
        
      
      
        
          Intel
          C++ 8.1, 9.0 on Windows, Linux.
        
      
      
        
          Metrowerks CodeWarrior 8.3,
          9.4, 9.5 on Mac OS X and Windows.
        
      
      
        
          Microsoft Visual C++
          6.0 (sp5, with and without STLport), 7.0, 7.1, 8.0. Note: Boost does not
          support the non-standard "Safe" C++ Library shipping with Visual
          C++ 8.0, which may result in many spurious warnings from Boost headers
          and other standards-conforming C++ code. To suppress these warnings, define
          the macro _SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE.
