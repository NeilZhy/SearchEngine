    Major Updates
    
      
        
          Range:
  Boost.Range has
          undergone extensive updates that it include all of the features from the
          recently reviewed Boost.RangeEx, from Neil Groves.
          
            
              
                Range-based version of the full STL iterator based algorithms.
              
            
            
              
                Range adaptors which can be combined with range-based algorithms
                for unprecedented expressiveness and efficiency.
              
            
            
              
                New functions: irange, istream_range, join, combine.
              
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Accumulators:
          
            
              
                Avoid premature template evaluation in operator overload return types.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Array:
          
            
              
                Added support for SunCC compiler.
              
            
            
              
                Added 'fill' member function.
              
            
            
              
                Changed exception code to use boost::throw_exception.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Improved performance.
              
            
            
              
                Reduced compile times.
              
            
            
              
                Reduced the size of generated code.
              
            
            
              
                Extended the guarantee that background threads don't call user code
                to all asynchronous operations (#3923).
              
            
            
              
                Changed to use edge-triggered epoll on Linux.
              
            
            
              
                Changed to use timerfd
                for dispatching timers on Linux, when available.
              
            
            
              
                Changed to use one-shot notifications with kqueue on Mac OS X and
                BSD platforms.
              
            
            
              
                Added a bitmask type ip::resolver_query_base::flags
                as per the TR2 proposal. This type prevents implicit conversion from
                int to flags, allowing the compiler to
                catch cases where users incorrectly pass a numeric port number as
                the service name.
              
            
            
              
                Added #define NOMINMAX for all Windows compilers.
                Users can define BOOST_ASIO_NO_NOMINMAX
                to suppress this definition (#3901).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a bug where 0-byte asynchronous reads were incorrectly passing
                an error::eof result to the completion handler
                (#4023).
              
            
            
              
                Changed the io_control() member functions to always call
                ioctl on the underlying
                descriptor when modifying blocking mode (#3307).
              
            
            
              
                Changed the resolver implementation to longer require the typedefs
                InternetProtocol::resolver_query
                and InternetProtocol::resolver_iterator,
                as neither typedef is part of the documented InternetProtocol
                requirements. The corresponding typedefs in the ip::tcp,
                ip::udp and ip::icmp
                classes have been deprecated.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed out-of-band handling for reactors not based on select().
              
            
            
              
                Added new BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_THREADS
                macro that allows Asio's threading support to be independently disabled.
              
            
            
              
                Minor documentation improvements.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Fusion:
          
            
              
                Added new macros for adapting or defining custom types. See the
                Changelog
                for details.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Iostreams:
          
            
              
                Minor fixes (#2505,

                #3953,
                #3723,

          Multi-index Containers:
          
            
              
                Serialization
                of non default constructible values is now properly supported
                through user-provided facilities save_construct_data
                and load_construct_data.
                multi_index_container
                serialization class

          Proto:
          
            
              
                Minor change in behavior: non-const expression self-assignment creates
                an assign node. See Proto's Release
                Notes for details.
              
            
            
              
                Minor change to recommended expression extension mechanism: use
                BOOST_PROTO_EXTENDS_USING_ASSIGN(). See Proto's Release
                Notes for details.
              
            
            
              
                Fix error in invocation of callable monomorphic function objects
                in Proto transforms.
              
            
            
              
                Fix misc const correctness issues, work around fusion bug.
              
            
            
              
                Add non-const function call overloads to proto terminals.
              
            
            
              
                Add a default constructor to proto::literal<>.
              
            
            
              
                Do not use deprecated config macros.
              
            
            
              
                Add proto::assert_matches()
                function and friends to <boost/proto/debug.hpp>.
              
            
            
              
                functional::make_expr<>

                Add documentation for Expr and Domain concepts.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Random:
          
            
              
                Put the implementation of random_device in a compiled lib, and added
                Windows support.
              
            
            
              
                Rewrote the documentation using Quickbook/Doxygen/Boostbook and brought
                it up to date.

    Build System
    
      
        
          When cross-compiling to GNU targets, static libraries are properly created.
          Previously, using such libraries resulted in Archive has no index
          error.
        
      
      
        
          The naming of DLL and import libraries with gcc compiler on Windows, both
          mingw and cygwin, now matches default conventions of those environments.
          Previously, the naming scheme was the same as for other Windows compilers.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Tools
    
      
        
          Quickbook:

                Disallow [ in simple
                markup. Fixes some errors with mismatched punctuation.
              
            
            
              
                Add a command line flag (-D) to define macros at the command
                line.
              
            
            
              
                Improved post-processor output.
              
            
            
              
                Check that [section] and [endsect]
                tags are balanced in templates.
              
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
    Compilers Tested
    
      Boost's primary test compilers are:
