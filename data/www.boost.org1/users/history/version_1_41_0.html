    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          DateTime:
          
            
              
                The default format for time durations is now "%-%O:%M:%S%F"
                instead of "%-%H:%M:%S%F" that was used previously.
                In order to retain the old behavior, the format string has to be
                specified explicitly during the time IO facet construction (#1861).
              
            
            
              
                Gregorian dates now use 32-bit integer type internally on 64-bit
                platforms (#3308).

          Iostreams:
  Some old
          unreleased developments. There are still several open issues that should
          be fixed in the next version.
          
            
              
                Add a grep filter (#1627).
              
            
            
              
                Support archives with multiple members (#1896).
              
            
            
              
                Make tee work with
                input streams (#791).
              
            
            
              
                Improved filesystem interoperability.
              
            
            
              
                Several warnings fixed or suppressed (including #1618,
                #1875,
                #2779).
              
            
            
              
                Various other fixes (including #1580,
                #1671).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Math:
  Substantially improved
          the performance of the incomplete gamma function and it's inverse: this
          enhances the performance of the gamma, poisson, chi-squared and non-central
          chi-squared distributions.

          fixes. Consult the library release
          notes for further information.
        
      
      
        
          Proto:
          
            
              
                Clean up some MSVC warnings and errors in /Za (disable Microsoft
                extensions) mode.
              
            
            
              
                Fixes for c++0x mode on various compilers.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Python:
  Boost.Python
          now supports Python 3 (Haoyu Bai's Google Summer of Code project, mentored
          by Stefan Seefeld).
        
      
      
        
          Regex:
  Added support
          for many Perl 5.10 syntax elements including named sub-expressions, branch
          resets and recursive regular expressions.
        
      
      
        
          Spirit: This is the
          initial official release of the new Spirit V2.1, a completely new library
          for parsing, lexing, and output generation. Note: this release is not backwards
          compatible with earlier versions. Known issue: qi::symbol::find
          will match a symbol that starts with the string you're searching for. This
          will be fixed in the next version.
        
      
      
        
          System:

          Thread:
          
            
              
                Support for futures, promises and packaged tasks added
              
            
            
              
                boost::thread_specific_ptr is now faster
                when there are lots of thread-specific objects
              
            
            
              
                Some Boost.Thread facilities are now header-only

  Major
          update:
          
            
              
                Replaced a lot of the macro based implementation with a cleaner template
                based implementation.
              
            
            
              
                Reduced memory use.

          Utility:
  A "const"
          issue of value_initialized
          is fixed: Its data()
          member function and its conversion operator are replaced by overloads for
          const and non-const access (#2548).
        
      
      
        
          Wave:

          for details.
        
      
      
        
          Xpressive:
          
            
              
                Fix infinite loop with some uses of \Q...\E quotemeta
                (#3586).
              
            
            
              
                Eliminate unreachable code warnings on MSVC
              
            
            
              
                Clean up some MSVC warnings and errors in /Za ("disable Microsoft
                extensions") mode.
              
            
            
              
                Fixes for c++0x mode on various compilers.
              
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
    Build System
    
      A bug preventing "fat" 32-bit + 64-bit builds on OSX has been fixed.
    
  
  
    Boost.CMake moved
    
      The cmake version of boost has moved; the Boost.CMmake release will be separate
      and will lag the main release slightly, but will also be capable of producing
      patch releases as necessary.

      CMake wiki page.
