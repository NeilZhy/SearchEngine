    Patches
    
      These are patches from library authors which were found too late to be fixed
      in the 1.54.0 release. Be careful as they have not been through the normal
      testing process.

      Supported CPUs
      
        Boost no longer supports the 80386 target CPU, the minimum x86 32-bit target
        is i486. The 80386 target was not properly supported by Boost.SmartPtr
        and Boost.Atomic (as well as the libraries
        that used them internally) even before this release. Some Boost libraries
        may have higher requirements on the minimum target CPU (like Boost.Log
        for example), see the respective library documentation for details.
      
      
        Also by default, when building Boost for x86 32-bit targets it will compile
        for i686 (Pentium Pro) and later CPUs. This can be changed by specifying
        the instruction-set property in b2
        or bjam command line, for example:
      
b2 variant=release architecture=x86 instruction-set=i486 stage
      
        Possible values for the instruction-set are:

      Signals deprecated
      
        Boost.Signals is no longer being actively maintained, so it has been deprecated.
        Do not use Boost.Signals for new development (use Boost.Signals2
        instead). If you have existing Boost.Signals-based code, it will continue
        to work, but consider moving to Boost.Signals2. There is a
        porting guide in the Signals2 documentation.

          Log:
  Logging library, from Andrey
          Semashev.
        
      
      
        
          TTI:
  Type Traits Introspection library,
          from Edward Diener.

          based on concepts.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Accumulators:
          
            
              
                Fixes comment typos (#7917)
              
            
            
              
                Silence unused variable warnings (#6926)
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Algorithm:
          
            
              
                The return types for copy_while and copy_until have been changed.
                This is an interface change. If you were using the return values
                from these functions, then you will have to modify your code. Instead
                of just returning the modified OutputIterator,
                these functions now return a std::pair<InputIterator, OutputIterator>. If this change affects your
                code, the simplest change is to add a .second to the end of the call,
                which will get you the same behavior that you had before.
              
            
            
              
                Added C++14 versions of 'is_permutation', 'equal' and 'mismatch'.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Any:
          
            
              
                Added C++11 features support #6999:
                
                  
                    
                      Move assignment and move constructors.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Added noexcept
                      modifiers.
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Added new traits classes, handler_type
                and async_result,
                that allow the customisation of the return type of an initiating
                function.
              
            
            
              
                Added the asio::spawn()
                function, a high-level wrapper for running stackful coroutines, based
                on the Boost.Coroutine library. The spawn() function enables programs to implement
                asynchronous logic in a synchronous manner. For example: size_t n
                = my_socket.async_read_some(my_buffer, yield);.
              
            
            
              
                Added the asio::use_future special value, which
                provides first-class support for returning a C++11 std::future from an asynchronous operation's
                initiating function. For example: future<size_t> n
                = my_socket.async_read_some(my_buffer, asio::use_future);.
              
            
            
              
                Promoted the stackless coroutine class and macros to be part of Asio's
                documented interface, rather than part of the HTTP server 4 example.
              
            
            
              
                Added a new handler hook called asio_handler_is_continuation.
                Asynchronous operations may represent a continuation of the asynchronous
                control flow associated with the current executing handler. The
                asio_handler_is_continuation
                hook can be customised to return true
                if this is the case, and Asio's implementation can use this knowledge
                to optimise scheduling of the new handler. To cover common cases,
                Asio customises the hook for strands, spawn() and composed asynchronous operations.
              
            
            
              
                Added four new generic protocol classes, generic::datagram_protocol,
                generic::raw_protocol, generic::seq_packet_protocol
                and generic::stream_protocol, which implement
                the Protocol type
                requirements, but allow the user to specify the address family (e.g.
                AF_INET) and protocol
                type (e.g. IPPROTO_TCP)
                at runtime.
              
            
            
              
                Added C++11 move constructors that allow the conversion of a socket
                (or acceptor) into a more generic type. For example, an ip::tcp::socket can be converted into a
                generic::stream_protocol::socket via move construction.
              
            
            
              
                Extended the basic_socket_acceptor<> class's accept() and async_accept() functions to allow a new connection
                to be accepted directly into a socket of a more generic type. For
                example, an ip::tcp::acceptor can be used to accept
                into a generic::stream_protocol::socket object.
              
            
            
              
                Moved existing examples into a C++03-specific directory, and added
                a new directory for C++11-specific examples. A limited subset of
                the C++03 examples have been converted to their C++11 equivalents.
              
            
            
              
                Various SSL enhancements. Thanks go to Nick Jones, on whose work
                these changes are based.
                
                  
                    
                      Added support for SSL handshakes with re-use of data already
                      read from the wire. New overloads of the ssl::stream<> class's handshake()
                      and async_handshake() functions have been added.
                      These accept a ConstBufferSequence
                      to be used as initial input to the ssl engine for the handshake
                      procedure.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Added support for creation of TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 ssl::context objects.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Added a set_verify_depth() function to the ssl::context and ssl::stream<>
                      classes.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Added the ability to load SSL certificate and key data from
                      memory buffers. New functions, add_certificate_authority(), use_certificate(), use_certificate_chain(), use_private_key(), use_rsa_private_key() and use_tmp_dh(), have been added to the
                      ssl::context class.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Changed ssl::context
                      to automatically disable SSL compression by default. To enable,
                      use the new ssl::context::clear_options() function, as in my_context.clear_options(ssl::context::no_compression).
                    
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a potential deadlock in signal_set
                implementation.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed an error in acceptor example in documentation #8421.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed copy-paste errors in waitable timer documentation #8602.
              
            
            
              
                Added assertions to satisfy some code analysis tools #7739.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a malformed #warning
                directive #7939.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a potential data race in the Linux epoll
                implementation.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a Windows-specific bug, where certain operations might generate
                an error_code with
                an invalid (i.e. NULL)
                error_category #8613.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed basic_waitable_timer's
                underlying implementation so that it can handle any time_point value without overflowing
                the intermediate duration objects.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a problem with lost thread wakeups that can occur when making
                concurrent calls to run() and poll() on the same io_service
                object #8354.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed implementation of asynchronous connect operation so that it
                can cope with spurious readiness notifications from the reactor #7961.

                ABI breaking: Changed bootstamp
                function in Windows to use EventLog service start time as system
                bootup time. Previously used LastBootupTime
                from WMI was unstable with time synchronization and hibernation and
                unusable in practice. If you really need to obtain pre Boost 1.54
                behaviour define BOOST_INTERPROCESS_BOOTSTAMP_IS_LASTBOOTUPTIME
                from command line or detail/workaround.hpp.

                Lexical cast is now capable of converting boost::int128_type

                Major reorganization to incorporate other Boost.Math like Integer
                Utilities (Greatest Common Divisor and Least Common Multiple), quaternions
                and octonions. Making new chapter headings.
              
            
            
              
                Added many references to Boost.Multiprecision and cpp_dec_float_50

                Fixed constants to use a thread-safe cache of computed values when
                used at arbitrary precision.

                Fixed nasty cyclic dependency bug that caused some headers to not
                compile #7999.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed bug in __tgamma that caused spurious overflow for arguments
                between 142.5 and 143.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed bug in raise_rounding_error that caused it to return an incorrect
                result when throwing an exception is turned off #7905.

                Adjusted heuristics used in Halley iteration to cope with inverting
                the incomplete beta in tricky regions where the derivative is flatlining.
                Example is computing the quantile of the Fisher F distribution for
                probabilities smaller than machine epsilon. See ticket #8314.
