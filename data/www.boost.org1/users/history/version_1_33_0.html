          Parameter
          Library:
  Write functions that accept arguments by name: especially
          useful when a function has more than one argument with a useful default
          value, since named arguments can be passed in any order.
        
      
      
        
          Pointer
          Container Library:

          packed behind an easy to use iterator interface, from Hartmut Kaiser.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Any Library: any_cast has been enhanced to allow direct
          access to any's held value.
        
      
      
        
          Assignment
          Library: Support for Pointer
          Container Library and new efficient functions ref_list_of() and cref_list_of() for generating anonymous ranges.
        
      
      
        
          Bind Library: Bind
          expressions now support comparisons
          and negation. Example: bind(&X::name, _1) < bind(&X::name, _2).
        
      
      
        
          Date-Time
          Library:
          
            
              
                Added local

                cuthill mckee
                ordering has been
                recast as an invocation of breadth
                first search
                and now supports graphs with multiple components.
              
            
            
              
                dijkstra shortest
                paths now uses
                a relaxed heap [61]
                as its priority queue, improving its complexity to O(V log V) and
                improving real-world performance for larger graphs.

                and supports arbitrary properties on the graph, from Ron Garcia.
                The old, Bison-based GraphViz reader has been deprecated and will
                be removed in a future Boost release. write graphviz
                also supports dynamic properties.
              
            
            
              
                subgraph: get_property now refers to the
                subgraph property, not the root graph's property.
              
            
            
              
                See the history
                for additional changes and bug fixes.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Multi-index

                notes.

                New customization method 'command_line_parser::extra_style_parser'.
                Unlike 'additional_parser', allows the user to parse several tokens
                and return a vector of options, not just a single option.
              
            
            
              
                Work with disabled exceptions.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Property
          Map Library: Introduced the dynamic properties
          class, which provides dynamically-typed access to a set of property maps.
        
      
      
        
          Boost.Python:
          
            
              
                Added support for docstrings on nonstatic properties.
              
            
            
              
                We now export the client-provided docstrings for init<optional<> >
                and XXX_FUNCTION_OVERLOADS() for only the last overload.
              
            
            
              
                Support for Embedded VC++ 4 and GCC-3.3 on MacOS added
              
            
            
              
                Introduced better support for rvalue from-python conversions of shared_ptr.
              
            
            
              
                Support for exposing vector<T*> with the indexing suite.
              
            
            
              
                updated visual studio project build file.
              
            
            
              
                Added search feature to the index page.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Random Number
          Library:
  Improved initialization for mersenne_twister,
          algorithm by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura, implemented for Boost
          by Jens Maurer.
  Note: All test vectors for mersenne_twisters
          constructed or seeded without parameters or with a single unsigned int
          parameter become invalid.
        
      
      
        
          Range Library: Minor
          addition of convenience functions to iterator
          range like front(), back() and operator[]().
        
      
      
        
          Regex Library:
          
            
              
                Rewritten front end parser now supports (?imsx-imsx) constructs,
                plus lookbehind assertions and conditional expressions.
              
            
            
              
                Thin wrapper classes improve integration with MFC/ATL code.
              
            
            
              
                Full (optional) Unicode support via the ICU library. Refer to the
                regex history
                page for more information on these and other small changes.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Serialization
          Library:
          
            
              
                DLL version.

                Improved serialization of shared pointers.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Signals Library: added
          slot blocking/unblocking, from Frantz Maerten. Huge improvements to signal
          invocation performance from Robert Zeh.
        
      
    
  
  
    Supported Compilers
    
      Boost is tested on a wide range of compilers and platforms. Since Boost libraries
      rely on modern C++ features not available in all compilers, not all Boost libraries
      will work with every compiler. The following compilers and platforms have been
      extensively tested with Boost, although many other compilers and platforms
      will work as well. For more information, see the regression
      test results.
    
    
      
        
          Apple GCC 3.x on Mac OS
          X.
        
      
      
        
          Borland C++
          5.6.4 on Windows.
        
      
      
        
          GNU C++ 2.95.3 (with and without
          STLport), 3.2.x., 3.3.x, 3.4.x, 4.0.x on Windows, Linux and Solaris.
        
      
      
        
          Intel
          C++ 8.1, 9.0 on Windows, Linux.
        
      
      
        
          Metrowerks CodeWarrior 8.3,
          9.4, 9.5 on Mac OS X and Windows.
        
      
      
        
          Microsoft Visual C++
          6.0 (sp5, with and without STLport), 7.0, 7.1, 8.0 beta. Note: due to intermittent
          problems with Visual C++ 8.0 beta, and the presence of a variety of pre-release
          compiler builds, we are unable to guarantee compatibility until the final
          compiler is released.
