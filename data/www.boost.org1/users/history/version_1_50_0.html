    Patches
    
      
        
          Boost.Unordered patch
          - Fixes a bug when compiled using a C++11 compiler, but with a C++03 allocator.
          When inserting elements, allocator_traits
          detects that the node can be constructed using an accidental implicit conversion
          which causes several problems.
        
      
      
        
          Locale
          Patch - Fixes a bug which causes boost::locale::utf::utf_traits
          to accept some invalid UTF-8 sequences, which is a possible security flaw.
        
      
    
  
  
    New Libraries
    
      
        
          Algorithm:
  A collection of
          useful generic algorithms, from Marshall Clow. This includes several different
          searching algorithms, as well as most of the new algorithms from the C++11
          standard library
        
      
      
        
          Functional/OverloadedFunction:
  Overload
          different functions into a single function object, from Lorenzo Caminiti.
        
      
      
        
          LocalFunction:
  Program
          functions locally, within other functions, directly within the scope where
          they are needed, from Lorenzo Caminiti.
        
      
      
        
          Utility/IdentityType:
  Wrap
          types within round parenthesis so they can always be passed as macro parameters,
          from Lorenzo Caminiti.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Accumulators:
          
            
              
                add missing #include
                <boost/throw_exception.hpp>, fixes #6702.
              
            
            
              
                work around for msvc which allows ctor templates to be copy ctors,
                fixes #6535.
              
            
            
              
                shorten filenames to meet boost guidelines, fixes #6196.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Array:
          
            
              
                add support for Boost.Hash #6791.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Changed the epoll_reactor
                backend to do lazy registration for EPOLLOUT
                events.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed the epoll_reactor
                handling of out-of-band data, which was broken by an incomplete fix
                in the last release.
              
            
            
              
                Changed Asio's SSL wrapper to respect OpenSSL's OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE
                feature test #define
                (#6432).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed windows::object_handle so that it works
                with Windows compilers that support C++11 move semantics (such as
                g++).
              
            
            
              
                Improved the performance of strand rescheduling.
              
            
            
              
                Added support for g++ 4.7 when compiling in C++11
                mode (#6620).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a problem where signal_set
                handlers were not being delivered when the io_service
                was constructed with a concurrency_hint
                of 1 (#6657).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Bimap:
          
            
              
                Remove spurious dependency on Boost.Serialization, fixes #3868.
              
            
            
              
                Solve unused constructor parameter warning, fixes #5749.
              
            
            
              
                Add key_type and mapped_type (leaving data_type for backward compatibility)
                typedefs to map views, fixes #6031.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Chrono:
          
            
              
                Fixed Bugs:
                
                  
                    
                      #6361
                      integer overflow in boost::chrono::process_real_cpu_clock::now()
                      under Windows 32bits.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      #6628
                      compiler warning in process_cpu_clocks.hpp.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      #6666
                      thread_clock.hpp needs pthread.h.
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Concept Check:
          
            
              
                Fixed:
                
                  
                    
                      #6738
                      Shadowed variable warning.
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Filesystem:
          
            
              
                Remove Filesystem Version 2 from the distribution. Version 3 is now
                the only distributed version. Those still using V2 are urged to migrate
                to V3 as soon as possible.
              
            
            
              
                Add constexpr value_type preferred_separator to class path.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #5118,
                replace_extension
                doesn't work as specified in documentation. The documentation, implementation,
                and test cases have all had fixes applied. The documentation had
                failed to mention that any existing extension is removed. The behavior
                for simple cases has been reverted to the Version 2 behavior, but
                with corrections so that complex replacements now work. Two test
                cases from #5118
                have been added.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #3737,
                Boost.Filesystem does not compile on Windows Mobile. On Windows,
                <sys/stat.h> is no longer included.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #4065,
                Boost Filesystem lexicographic path comparison inconsistent. This
                required multiple source code bug fixes and code cleanup, correcting
                problems not related to lexicographical issues.
              
            
            
              
                Add class path member function compare for consistency with std::string.
              
            
            
              
                Tighten BOOST_FILESYSTEM_DYN_LINK
                and BOOST_FILESYSTEM_STATIC_LINK
                logic in filesystem/config.hpp
                so that one or the other is always defined, and both being defined
                is a #error.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #6690
                and #6737,
                resolving static linking related problems with VC++ 8 through 11.
                Note that this fix may reintroduce codecvt thread safety problems
                #4889,
                #6320,
                for these compilers if static linking is used.
              
            
            
              
                Add path::operator+=
                and concat functions to tack on things like suffixes or numbers.
                Suggested by Ed Smith-Rowland and others.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #6809,
                Implementation of filesystem::rename() method for MS Windows is wrong,
                by adding MOVEFILE_COPY_ALLOWED
                to deal with renames across drives, volumes, file systems. Fix has
                no effect on non-Windows systems.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #6819,
                A path operand with a source that was a one character array was treated
                as empty, even if it wasn't empty. Such arrays can occur in unions
                or in code using C variable length array idioms.
              
            
            
              
                Fix #6932,
                create_directories throws exception even if error_code
                is specified.

                Revert fix for #6131
                which caused more harm than good.

                Changed constant initialization mechanism so that it is thread safe
                even for user-defined types, also so that user defined types get
                the full precision of the constant, even when long
                double does not. So for example
                128-bit rational approximations will work with UDT's and do the right
                thing, even though long double may be only 64 or 80 bits.
