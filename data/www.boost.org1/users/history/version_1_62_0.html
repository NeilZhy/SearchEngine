    New Libraries
    
      
        
          Fiber:
  Framework for userland-threads/fibers,
          from Oliver Kowalke.
        
      
      
        
          QVM:
  Boost QVM is a
          generic library for working with quaternions, vectors and matrices of static
          size with the emphasis on 2, 3 and 4-dimensional operations needed in graphics,
          video games and simulation applications, from Emil Dotchevski.
        
      
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Atomic:
          
            
              
                Improved support for Oracle Studio and SPARC. The library now provides
                native atomic operations on SPARCv8+.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Chrono:
          
            
              
                #11330
                boost::chrono::duration default constructor doesn't initialize rep_
              
            
            
              
                #11618
                Chrono IO V2 doc ios_state.hpp does not exist
              
            
            
              
                #11631
                boost chrono io v2 does not let you support custom clocks
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Circular Buffer:
          
            
              
                Debug implementation is no longer used by default in debug mode.
                Debug implementation does not have the same thread safety guarantees
                as the normal (release) implementation or other containers. As a
                result of this change BOOST_CB_DISABLE_DEBUG
                macro is no longer used. BOOST_CB_ENABLE_DEBUG=1
                should be defined instead to enable debug support. (#6277)

                      Added new tools for inter-process logging on a local machine.
                      The implementation includes a resource name wrapper, an inter-process
                      message queue and a sink backend.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Added a new character decorator called max_size_decor.
                      The new decorator allows to limit the output of its adopted
                      formatter up to the specified length.

                of the type as const char*
                at compile time. So we can do a lot of interesting things at compile time: check namespace of a type, sort
                types according to their lexical representation, check that type
                is a template type and so on... A few examples were provided.
