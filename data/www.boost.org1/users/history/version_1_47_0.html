                Better integration of proto::basic_expr
                to avoid accidental needless instantiations of proto::expr.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Random:
          
            
              
                Synchronized with the new standard.
                
                  
                    
                      Many new distributions added: chi_squared_distribution,
                      negative_binomial_distribution,
                      fisher_f_distribution,

                      Renamed uniform_int
                      and uniform_real
                      to uniform_int_distribution
                      and uniform_real_distribution.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Added members to all distributions: param_type,
                      param, stream
                      operators, comparison operators, min
                      and max.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Allow distributions to be used directly with generators without
                      use of variate_generator.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Changed the meaning of the parameters of geometric_distribution
                      and lognormal_distribution.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Added a second parameter to gamma_distribution.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Added seed_seq
                      and added the corresponding constructors and seed overloads the generators.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Added generate_canonical.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Renamed the engine tempates. e.g. mersenne_twister
                      becomes mersenne_twister_engine.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      New engine adapter independent_bits_engine.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Added new predefined engine typedefs: mt19937_64,
                      ranlux[24|48][_base],
                      knuth_b.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Updated seeding algorithms.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Added discard
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Use unsigned types instead of signed types in all the predefined
                      engines.
                    
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                Bug fixes:
                
                  
                    
                      linear_congruential_engine
                      could assert because the modular arithmetic was not implemented
                      in all cases. shuffle_output,
                      now called shuffle_order_engine,
                      could cause integer overflow. These cases were not triggered
                      by any predefined engines.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      uniform_small_int
                      now actually behaves as documented.
                    
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                New efficient algorithms for binomial_distribution
                and poisson_distribution.

                Backwards compatibility issues:
                
                  
                    
                      The seeding algorithms have changed. This was unavoidable for
                      compatibility with the standard. Not to mention that some of
                      the existing algorithms were weird and inconsistent.
                      
                        
                          
                            Seeding with an integer: The behaviour should be unchanged
                            for most generators except lagged_fibonacci
                            and subtract_with_carry
                            (and thus ranlux).
                          
                        
                        
                          
                            Seeding a generator with another generator: This has
                            been enabled by making all all generators models of
                            SeedSeq.
                            Therefore, if you seed a Boost.Random generator with
                            a non Boost.Random generator, your code will no longer
                            compile. The algorithm has changed, so code using this
                            seeding method will yield different values.
                          
                        
                        
                          
                            Seeding a generator from a pair of iterators: This implicitly
                            assumed that the elements were 32-bit integers in some
                            places, but not everywhere. I've added this requirement
                            everywhere and updated the algorithms accordingly. The
                            behaviour of generators with a value_type
                            no more than 32 bits should be unchanged.
                          
                        
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Renaming:
                      
                        
                          
                            Whenever a class was renamed, there is a wrapper with
                            the old name. There are also using declarations in namespace
                            boost for everything that was moved.
                          
                        
                        
                          
                            The names of a few accessors in the distributions changed.
                            Both the old and the new names are allowed.
                          
                        
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      geometric_distribution
                      and lognormal_distribution:
                      The behaviour is different at runtime. boost::geometric_distribution
                      and boost::lognormal_distribution provide
                      the old behaviour, boost::random::geometric_distribution
                      and boost::random::lognormal_distribution provide
                      the new behaviour.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Streaming: gamma_distribution has a new parameter, thus text
                      saved with the old version will not readable by the new version.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      variate_generator
                      is now a simple pass through wrapper. Code that assumes that
                      it will adjust the generator's result type to match the distribution
                      will no longer work. This is not an issue with any of the distributions
                      provided by Boost.Random.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Return types: The result_types
                      of some generators have changed slightly. Some signed types
                      have changed to unsigned to match the standard.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      has_fixed_range:
                      This is now always false, as it doesn't appear to be very useful
                      and is excessively cumbersome. Anything that was accessing
                      const_min and
                      const_max without
                      first checking has_fixed_range
                      was incorrect to begin with.

          with the old name bjam
          to prevent third-party build scripts from failing.
