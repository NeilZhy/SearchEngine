    Boost.CMake
    
      Boost.CMake is now distributed separately.
      The cmake build for boost is BROKEN in the
      tarballs above. See the Boost.CMake
      wiki page for pointers to working versions.
    
  
  
    Updated Libraries
    
      
        
          Accumulators:
          
            
              
                Works on GCC 4.4.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Asio:
          
            
              
                Added a new ping example to illustrate the use of ICMP sockets.
              
            
            
              
                Changed the buffered*_stream<> templates to treat 0-byte
                reads and writes as no-ops, to comply with the documented type requirements
                for SyncReadStream,
                AsyncReadStream,
                SyncWriteStream and
                AsyncWriteStream.
              
            
            
              
                Changed some instances of the throw
                keyword to boost::throw_exception() to allow Asio to be used when exception
                support is disabled. Note that the SSL wrappers still require exception
                support (#2754).
              
            
            
              
                Made Asio compatible with the OpenSSL 1.0 beta (#3256).
              
            
            
              
                Eliminated a redundant system call in the Solaris /dev/poll
                backend.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed a bug in resizing of the bucket array in the internal hash
                maps (#3095).
              
            
            
              
                Ensured correct propagation of the error code when a synchronous
                accept fails (#3216).
              
            
            
              
                Ensured correct propagation of the error code when a synchronous
                read or write on a Windows HANDLE fails.
              
            
            
              
                Fixed failures reported when _GLIBCXX_DEBUG
                is defined (#3098).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed custom memory allocation support for timers (#3107).
              
            
            
              
                Tidied up various warnings reported by g++ (#1341,
                #2618).
              
            
            
              
                Various documentation improvements, including more obvious hyperlinks
                to function overloads, header file information, examples for the
                handler type requirements, and adding enum values to the index (#3157,
                #2620).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Circular Buffer:
          
            
              
                Fixed bugs #2785,
                #3285.

          Fusion:
          
            
              
                Improved compile times for fusion::vector.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Graph:
          
            
              
                Merged in the Parallel
                Boost Graph Library, giving a full suite of graph algorithms
                and data structures for distributed-memory computers (such as clusters).
              
            
            
              
                Updates to the interface of the compressed sparse row graph, including
                constructors from unsorted edge lists.

                New algorithms: Dijkstra's single-source shortest path algorithm
                without a separate color map and an algorithm to find maximal common
                subgraphs between two graphs.
              
            
            
              
                Assorted bug fixes.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Hash:
          
            
              
                Automatically configure the float functions using template metaprogramming
                instead of trying to configure every possibility manually.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Interprocess:
          
            
              
                Windows shared memory is created in Shared Documents folder so that
                it can be shared between services and processes

                Added mpl::char_ and mpl::string
                for compile-time string manipulation, based on multichar literals
                (#2905).

          Program.Options:
          
            
              
                Support for building with disabled exceptions (#2096).
              
            
            
              
                Unicode parser no longer drops original tokens (#2425).
              
            
            
              
                Fixed crash on user-inserted items in variables_map
                (#2782).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Property Map:
          
            
              
                Moved property map code into a separate directory, boost/property_map/.
                The old files exist and forward to the new ones; the previous files
                directly in boost/ will be removed in Boost 1.42.0.
              
            
            
              
                Moved distributed property maps to boost::graph::parallel
                namespace.
              
            
            
              
                Added a property map based on a boost::shared_array,
                providing a simpler interface.

                PrimitiveTransforms have stricter conformance to ResultOf protocol.
                (Warning: some invalid code may break.)
              
            
            
              
                Add a sensible default for proto::_default's
                template parameter.
              
            
            
              
                Improved default evaluation strategy for pointers to members.
              
            
            
              
                GCC 3.4 portability fixes (#3021).
              
            
            
              
                Work around Visual C++'s non-std-compliant ciso646 macros.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Random:
          
            
              
                Made the constructors of all the generators call the copy constructor
                when passed a non-const reference.
              
            
            
              
                Changed seeding functions to accept any arithmetic type. As a side-effect,
                the exact signature of seed changed for some classes.
              
            
            
              
                Major bug fixes in uniform_int.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Serialization:
          
            
              
                Removed deprecated headers: boost/static_warning.hpp,
                boost/state_saver.hpp, boost/smart_cast.hpp,
                boost/pfto.hpp. Use the the equivalent headers
                in the boost/serialization/
                directory instead (#3062).
              
            
            
              
                detail::archive_serializer_map should now
                be used instead of detail::archive_pointer_iserializer.
                For more details see the
                library release notes.

                Some minor tweaks for better compiler support (#2908,
                #3096,
                #3082).
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          Xpressive:
          
            
              
                Works on Visual C++ 10.0 (#3124).
              
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
    Build System
    
      The default naming of libraries in Unix-like environment now matches system
      conventions, and does not include various decorations. Naming of libraries
      on Cygwin was also fixed. Support for beta versions of Microsoft Visual Studio
      10 was added. With gcc, 64-bit compilation no longer requires that target architecture
      be specified.
