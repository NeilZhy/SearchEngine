              Introduction
              Open source isn't just for nerds and researchers. Real world
              programming challenges, irrespective of whether they are open
              or closed source, can benefit enormously from the thought and
              experience that has gone into the Boost software libraries. Put
              simply, for any given problem for which Boost provides a
              solution, Boost will strive to provide the best solution
              possible. It's up to you to decide whether we've achieved that,
              but as these pages will testify, many other developers have
              found our solutions to be the best for them.
              Disclaimer: Boost's developers try to ensure that
              the information on these pages is correct, but from time to
              time inadvertent mistakes are bound to occur: if you would like
              an entry in these pages to be removed or corrected please
              contact the Boost
              Moderators.
              Submissions
              If you have an application or library that's using Boost and
              would like to be listed here, please post the following
              information to the main
              Boost developer mailing list:
              
                The name of the Application/Product/Service.
                The name of the company (where appropriate).
                A paragraph describing the
                Application/Product/Service.
                Any information you can provide about which parts of
                Boost you used, along with any comments you may have on how
                Boost helped your product development.
                URLs to your companies home page, and the home page of
                the Application/Product/Service if there is one.
              
              Finally, if the subheadings used in the structure of these
              pages don't fit your Product/Application/Service please say so:
              we're always interested to hear how these pages can be improved
              or better structured.
