              Boost Mailing Lists (A.K.A. Discussion Groups)
            
            
              The mailing lists are the heart of the Boost community. You
              may read the lists via full-content email, email digests, or
              via newsgroup reader.
              Hosting for the mailing lists is donated by the Open Systems Lab at
              Indiana University.
              Access to Boost mailing lists via newsgroup (NNTP) is
              contributed by GMANE.
              
                Before Posting
                Read the Discussion Policy
                and Guide to Effective Posting. Doing so will
                help you to ensure that your post is read by the people who
                can help you and received in the spirit in which it was
                intended.
                Subscribe your posting address. As an
                anti-spam measure, postings to most Boost mailing lists will
                only be accepted if the posting's "From:" header contains an
                email address that is subscribed to the list. If you try to
                post from an address that isn't subscribed, you will probably
                get a message that says:
                
                  You are not allowed to post to this mailing list,
                  and your message has been automatically rejected. If you
                  think that your messages are being rejected in error,
                  contact the mailing list owner at list
                  administrator's email address.
                
                If you need to post from multiple email addresses, you
                should subscribe each one separately. You can configure your
                subscription settings for any address to disable mail
                delivery via each mailing list's web interface.
                Even postings made through the GMane news server
                need to be made from subscribed addresses because GMane
                simply forwards your postings on to the appropriate email
                list. Don't be fooled by GMane's authentication message that
                says "you are now authorized to post to this list" after you
                answer its autogenerated mail; only subscribed addresses may
                post.

              Boost Users mailing list
              (also available via newsgroup)
              This list is oriented toward casual users of the Boost
              libraries. It is a good place to start if you are having
              trouble getting started with Boost or its individual libraries.
              Feel free to post both "newbie" and more challenging questions,
              but please check first to see if there's an appropriate
              Project-Specific list; you'll often get
              better answers in a forum dedicated to your problem area. This
              list is relatively low volume (less than 500 per month).
              Subscribe or unsubscribe at the Boost Users list home page.
              For those who prefer to participate via an NNTP (newsgroup)
              interface, a gateway to the Boost Users mailing list is
              available at news://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.boost.user.
              You can also browse Gmane's searchable archive.
              Boost developers mailing list
              (also available via newsgroup)
              This is the main Boost mailing list. It is high volume (over
              1000 messages per month), very technical, and oriented toward
              Boost library developers. It is also read by many other members
              interested in watching the Boost library development process.
              Virtually all Boost decisions, major or minor, technical or
              otherwise, are reached via public discussion on this mailing
              list. It is where the formal reviews of proposed libraries take
              place. Subscribe or unsubscribe at https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost.
              When we talk about the "members of Boost", we are talking
              about those signed up for this main mailing list.
              For those who prefer to participate via an NNTP (newsgroup) interface, a gateway
              to the Boost mailing list is available at news://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.boost.devel.
              Archives for Boost
              developers list
              Archives of Boost messages include the Boost GMane NNTP Archive and of course
              there is a Google search link for our MailMan Archive on our home
              page.
              Boost Announce mailing
              list
              This is an announce-only list for notification of upcoming
              software releases and formal reviews of proposed libraries. One
              to three messages per month.  Subscribe or unsubscribe at
              the Boost Announce list home page.
              Boost Interest Mailing
              List
              This list is a moderated low-traffic announcement-only list
              of interest to the Boost community. On topic messages will
              include announcements of books, magazine articles, papers,
              talks, seminars, products, tools, events, or conferences on
              advanced uses of C++, generic/generative/meta-programming, and,
              of course, the Boost libraries. Off topic will be discussion of
              any kind. Job postings are accepted at the moderators'
              discretion. Subscribe or unsubscribe at the Boost-Interest home page.
              Project-Specific
              listsSeveral mailing lists have been established for
              specific Boost projects:
              Boost.Build list
              The mailing list for the Boost
              Build System is located here. GMane provides NNTP access and Searchable Archives as well.
              Boost CMake list
              Development of the experimental CMake build
              system is being coordinated on the Boost
              CMake mailing list. Any questions about CMake should be
              asked here and not on the main Boost.Build list. GMane provides
              NNTP
              access and Searchable
              Archives.
              Python C++-Sig (for
              Boost.Python)
              The Python C++-sig is not strictly Boost-specific,
              but nearly all the traffic concerns Boost.Python. See also the
              Language Binding list below. You can
              join the mailing list, GMane provides
              NNTP access and Searchable Archives as well. There are
              also searchable archives at ASPN.
              Language
              Binding
              The Language Binding list is for discussion of
              a generalized framework for binding C++ to other languages and
              systems based on the technology of Boost.Python and Luabind.
              The plan is to provide a single front-end for describing
              bindings with runtime-pluggable back ends for binding to
              specific languages. It is highly recommended that new
              subscribers read through the message history from the beginning
              before posting; it will save time as much design progress has
              already been made. GMane provides NNTP access and Searchable Archives as well.
              Boost.MPI Development
              A separate developer mailing list for Boost.MPI specific topics is
              located here.
              Boost.Spirit lists
              Spirit has two additional mailing lists. Spirit-general for Spirit users and
              Spirit-devel for Spirit developers (open
              to anyone who wishes to hang out with Spirit coders). Both have
              GMane NNTP
              access (Spirit-general and Spirit-devel) with searchable archives (
              Spirit-general and Spirit-devel).
              Boost.Documentation
              list
              The mailing list for the Boost Documentation
              System is located here. GMane provides NNTP access and Searchable Archives as well.
              uBLAS development
              (ublas-dev) list
              A separate user and developer mailing list for Boost
              uBLAS specific topics is located here.
              Thread development
              (threads-devel) list
              A separate developer mailing list for Boost Thread
              specific topics is located here.
              Important: This mailing list is for the
              discussion of the specification and implementation of
              Boost.Threads only  questions regarding
              usage should be directed to the Boost
              Users list, or the main Boost
              developers list.
              GMane provides NNTP
              access and 
              Searchable Archives as well.
              Testing list
              The setup, procedures and tools necessary for running Boost
              regression tests are discussed on this list. The list main participants are
              regression runners - people who run Boost tests on a variety of
              compilers and platforms, and the maintainers of tools for
              collecting and processing test results.
              Important: questions relevant to a wider audience,
              including questions about Boost.Test framework or test results
              for a particular library, should be posted to main development
              list.NNTP access and Searchable Archives are available on GMane.
              Translation
              Groups
              Boost doesn't have the resources to translate the
              documentation itself, but there is at least one separate group
              translating the documentation. If you have formed another, tell
              us on the documentation list and we'll
              add a link.

              #boost IRC channel
              In addition to the mailing lists presented above, a #boost
              IRC channel on freenode is
              frequented by some boost users. As usual with IRC channels, one
              should not necessarily expect that his questions will be
              answered. The channel is not moderated.
