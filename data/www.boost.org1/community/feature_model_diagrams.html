              Feature Model Diagrams in text and HTML
              By Beman
              Dawes
            
            
              Introduction
              In their seminal book, Generative Programming, Czarnecki and
              Eisenecker (C&E))
              describe how to build feature models [C&E 4.4] consisting
              of a feature diagram plus semantic, rationale, and other
              attributes. Feature models are then used to drive design cycles
              which eventually lead to manual or automatic assembly of
              configurations.
              Feature models provide a language to describe the library
              variability that is often such an issue in boost.org
              discussions. The Whorf hypothesis that "Language shapes the way
              we think, and determines what we can think about" seems to
              apply. In discussion of library variability issues, we have
              been crippled by lack of a good language. With feature models
              we now have a language to carry on the dialog.
              The graphical feature diagrams presented by C&E are not
              in a suitable form for the email discussions boost.org depends
              upon. The hierarchical nature of feature diagrams can be
              represented by a simple text-based feature diagram language. A
              feature model can also take advantage of the hyperlinks
              inherent in HTML.
              Grammar
              The grammar for the feature diagram language is expressed in
              Extended Bakus-Naur Form; ::= represents productions, [...]
              represents options, {...} represents zero or more instances,
              and represents | alternatives.
              
feature-model       ::= concept-name details { feature }
feature             ::= feature-name [details]
details             ::= "(" feature-list ")"      // required features
                      | "[" feature-list "]"      // optional features
feature-list        ::= element { "|" element }   // one only
                      | element { "+" element }   // one or more
                      | element { "," element }   // all
                                                  // [a+b] equivalent to [a,b]
element             ::= feature
                      | details
concept-name        ::= name
feature-name        ::= name
              The usual lexical conventions apply. Names are
              case-insensitive and consist of a leading letter, followed by
              letters, digits, underscores or hyphens, with no spaces
              allowed.
              At least one instance of each name should be hyperlinked to
              the corresponding Feature
              Description.
              While the grammar is intended for written communication
              between people, it may also be trivially machine parsed for use
              by automatic tools.
              
              Descriptive information is associated with each concept or
              feature. According to [C&E 4.4.2] this includes:
              
                Semantic descriptions.
                Rationale.
                Stakeholders and client programs.
                Exemplar systems.
                Constraints and default dependency rules.
                Availability sites, binding sites, and binding mode.
                Open/Closed attribute.
              
              What is a Feature?
              A feature [C&E 4.9.1] is "anything users or client
              programs might want to control about a concept. Thus, during
              feature modeling, we document no only functional features ...
              but also implementation features, ..., various optimizations,
              alternative implementation techniques, and so on."
              Example
              
special-container ( organization,
                    performance,
                    interface  )         // all required
organization [ ordered + indexed ]       // zero or more (4 configurations)
indexed [ hash-function ]                // zero or one  (2 configurations)
performance ( fast | small | balanced )  // exactly one  (3 configurations)
interface ( STL-style + cursor-style )   // one or more  (3 configurations)
              There should be feature descriptions for
              some-container, organization, ordered, indexed,
              hash-function, performance, fast, small, balanced, interface,
              STL-style, and cursor-style.
              The number of possible configurations is (2 + 2*2) * 3 * 3 =
              54, assuming no constraints.
              There are equivalent representations. For example:
              
special-container ( organization[ ordered+indexed[ hash-function ]],
                    performance( fast|small|balanced ),
                    interface( STL-style+cursor-style ) )
