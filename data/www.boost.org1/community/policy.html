              Email discussion is the tie that binds boost members
              together into a community. If the discussion is stimulating and
              effective, the community thrives. If the discussion degenerates
              into name calling and ill will, the community withers and
              dies.

              Effective
              Posting
              Most Boost mailing lists host a great deal of traffic, so
              your post is usually competing for attention with many other
              communications. This section describes how to make sure it has
              the desired impact.
              Well-Crafted Posting is Worth the Effort
              Don't forget, you're a single writer but there are many
              readers, and you want them to stay interested in what you're
              saying. Saving your readers a little time and effort is usually
              worth the extra time you spend when writing a message. Also,
              boost discussions are saved for posterity, as rationales and
              history of the work we do. A post's usefulness in the future is
              determined by its readability.
              Put the Library Name in the Subject Line
              When your post is related to a particular Boost library,
              it's helpful to put the library name in square brackets at the
              beginning of the subject line, e.g.
              
                Subject: [Regex] Why doesn't this pattern match?
              
              The Boost developers' list is a high-volume mailing list,
              and most maintainers don't have time to read every message. A
              tag on the subject line will help ensure the right people see
              your post.
              Don't Use Tabs
              If you use tabs to indent your source code, convert them to
              spaces before inserting the code in a posting. Something in the
              processing chain usually strips all the indentation and leaves
              a mess behind.
              Limit Line
              Length
              If you put source code in your postings and your mailer
              wraps long lines automatically, either keep the code narrow or
              insert the code as an (inline, if possible) attachment. That
              will help ensure others can read what you've posted.
              Don't Overquote, Don't 
              Top-Post, and Do Use Inline Replies for Readable Quotations
              Please prune extraneous quoted text from
              replies so that only the relevant parts are included. Some
              people have to pay for, or wait for, each byte that they
              download from the list. More importantly, it will save time and
              make your post more valuable when readers do not have to find
              out which exact part of a previous message you are responding
              to.
              Don't top-post;
              inline replies are the appropriate posting style
              for Boost lists.
              The common and very useful inline approach cites the small
              fractions of the message you are actually responding to and
              puts your response directly beneath each citation, with a blank
              line separating them for readability:
              Person-you're-replying-to wrote:
> Some part of a paragraph that you wish to reply to goes 
> here; there may be several lines.
Your response to that part of the message goes here.  There may,
of course, be several lines.
> The second part of the  paragraph that is relevant to your 
> reply goes here; agiain there may be several lines.
Your response to the second part of the message goes here.

              For more information about effective use of quotation in
              posts, see this helpful guide.
              Keep the Formatting of Quotations Consistent
              Some email and news clients use poor word wrapping
              algorithms that leave successive lines from the same quotation
              with differing numbers of leading ">"
              characters. Microsoft Outlook and
              Outlook Express, and some web clients, are
              especially bad about this. If your client offends in this way,
              please take the effort to clean up the mess it makes in quoted
              text. Remember, even if you didn't write the original text,
              it's your posting; whether you get your point across
              depends on its readability.
              The Microsoft clients also create an unusually verbose
              header at the beginning of the original message text and leave
              the cursor at the beginning of the message, which encourages
              users to write their replies before all of the quoted text
              rather than putting the reply in context. Fortunately, Dominic
              Jain has written a utility that fixes all of these problems
              automatically: Outlook Quotefix for Outlook Users and OE QuoteFix for users of Outlook Express.
              Summarizing and Referring to Earlier Messages
              A summary of the foregoing thread is only needed after a
              long discussion, especially when the topic is drifting or a
              result has been achieved in a discussion. The mail system will
              do the tracking that is needed to enable mail readers to
              display message threads (and every decent mail reader supports
              that).
              If you ever have to refer to single message earlier in a
              thread or in a different thread then you can use a URL to the
              message archives. To help to
              keep those URLs short, you can use tinyurl.com. Citing the relevant portion
              of a message you link to is often helpful (if the citation is
              small).
              Maintain the Integrity of Discussion Threads
              When starting a new topic, always send a fresh
              message, rather than beginning a reply to some other
              message and replacing the subject and body. Many mailers are
              able to detect the thread you started with and will show the
              new message as part of the original thread, which probably
              isn't what you intended. Follow this guideline for your own
              sake as well as for others'. Often, people scanning for
              relevant messages will decide they're done with a topic and
              hide or kill the entire thread: your message will be missed,
              and you won't get the response you're looking for.
              By the same token, When replying to an existing
              message, use your mailer's "Reply" function, so that
              the reply shows up as part of the same discussion thread.
              Do not reply to digests if you are a digest
              delivery subscriber. Your reply will not be properly threaded
              and will probably have the wrong subject line. Instead, you can
              reply through the GMane web interface.
              Keep The Size of Your Posting Manageable
              The mailing list software automatically limits message and 
              attachment size to a reasonable amount, typically 75K, which is 
              adjusted from time-to-time by the moderators. This limit is a 
              courtesy to those who rely on dial-up Internet access, and let's 
              face it, no one wants to read a posting that consists of 75K of 
              error message text.
              Prohibited
              Behavior
              Prohibited behavior will not be tolerated. The moderators
              will ban postings by abusers.
              Flame wars
              Personal insults, argument for the sake of argument, and all
              the other behaviors which fall into the "flame war" category
              are prohibited. Discussions should focus on technical
              arguments, not the personality traits or motives of
              participants.
              Third-party attacks
              Attacks on third parties such as software vendors, hardware
              vendors, or any other organizations, are prohibited. Boost
              exists to unite and serve the entire C++ community, not to
              disparage the work of others.
              Does this mean that we ban the occasional complaint or wry
              remark about a troublesome compiler? No, but be wary of
              overdoing it.
              Off-topic posts
              Discussions which stray from the acceptable topics are
              strongly discouraged. While off-topic posts are often well
              meaning and not as individually corrosive as other abuses,
              cumulatively the distraction damages the effectiveness of
              discussion.
              Culture
              In addition to technical skills, Boost members value
              collaboration, acknowledgement of the help of others, and a
              certain level of politeness. Boost membership is very
              international, and ranges widely in age and other
              characteristics. Think of discussion as occurring among
              colleagues in a widely read forum, rather than among a few
              close friends.
              Always remember that the cumulative effort spent by people
              reading your contribution scales with the (already large)
              number of boost members. Thus, do invest time and effort to
              make your message as readable as possible. Adhere to English
              syntax and grammar rules such as proper capitalization. Avoid
              copious informalism, colloquial language, or abbreviations,
              they may not be understood by all readers. Re-read your message
              before submitting it.
              Guidelines for Effective Discussions
              Apply social engineering to prevent heated technical
              discussion from degenerating into a shouting match, and to
              actively encourage the cooperation upon which Boost
              depends.
              
                Questions help. If someone suggests something that you
                don't think will work, then replying with a question like
                "will that compile?" or "won't that fail to compile, or am I
                missing something?" is a lot smoother than "That's really
                stupid - it won't compile." Saying "that fails to compile for
                me, and seems to violate section n.n.n of the standard" would
                be yet another way to be firm without being abrasive.
                If most of the discussion has been code-free
                generalities, posting a bit of sample code can focus people
                on the practical issues.
                If most of the discussion has been in terms of specific
                code, try to talk a bit about hidden assumptions and
                generalities that may be preventing discussion closure.
                Taking a time-out is often effective. Just say: "Let me
                think about that for a day or two. Let's take a time-out to
                digest the discussion so far."
              
              Avoid Parkinson's Bicycle Shed.
              Parkinson described a committee formed to oversee design of an
              early nuclear power plant. There were three agenda items - when
              to have tea, where to put the bicycle shed, and how to ensure
              nuclear safety. Tea was disposed of quickly as trivial. Nuclear
              safety was discussed for only an hour - it was so complex,
              scary, and technical that even among experts few felt
              comfortable with the issues. Endless days were then spent
              discussing construction of the bicycle shed (the parking lot
              would be the modern equivalent) because everyone though they
              understood the issues and felt comfortable discussing them.
              Library Names
              In order to ensure a uniform presentation in books and
              articles, we have adopted a convention for referring to Boost
              libraries. Library names can either be written in a compact
              form with a dot, as "Boost.Name", or in a long form
              as "the Boost Name library." For example:
              
                Boost.Python serves a very different
                purpose from the Boost Graph library.
              
              Note that the word "library" is not part of the name, and as
              such isn't capitalized.
              Please take care to avoid confusion in discussions between
              libraries that have been accepted into Boost and those that
              have not. Acceptance as a Boost library indicates that the code
              and design have passed through our peer-review process; failing
              to make the distinction devalues the hard work of library
              authors who've gone through that process. Here are some
              suggested ways to describe potential Boost libraries:
              
                the proposed Boost Name library
                the Boost.Name candidate
                the Name library (probably the best choice
                where applicable)
              
              Note that this policy only applies to discussions, not to
              the documentation, directory structure, or even identifiers in
              the code of potential Boost libraries.
