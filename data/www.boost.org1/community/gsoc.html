  Boost
  C++ Libraries
  
  
  ...one of the most highly
  regarded and expertly designed C++ library projects in the
  world.  Herb Sutter and Andrei
  Alexandrescu, C++

              Boost C++ Libraries
            
            
              Since 2005, Boost has participated in the Google Summer of Code,
              initiative, a program by which student developers are sponsored
              for their contributions within open source organizations
              willing to mentor the participants.
              
              Currently the application process begins around
              December/January by the student 
              reviewing past GSoC project ideas and approaching the Boost
              developers mailing list to find a mentor willing to mentor
              them and codevelop a project proposal to be submitted to Google
              for funding the coming summer. Students should expect to be
              flexible with regard to what topics and proposals mentors are
              willing to mentor.
              
              If you arrive to the process too late to prearrange a mentor,
              some potential mentors supply prewritten project proposals with
              C++ programming competency tests on 
              this year's GSoC Project Ideas page. If you have in the past
              made a substantial contribution to a well known open source
              project, it may be possible to skip the C++ programming competency
              exam.
Github's for standalone GSoCs past and present
Since 2013 with Boost's transition to git we have kept a single umbrella org on github for those GSoCs which are fairly self standing. Incremental extensions to existing libraries usually enter that library's main git repo as an experimental branch. Here are those orgs:
GSoC 2013:  https://github.com/BoostGSoC13
GSoC 2014:  https://github.com/BoostGSoC14
GSoC 2015:  https://github.com/BoostGSoC15
Students may find examining past GSoC source code and commit histories of use.
