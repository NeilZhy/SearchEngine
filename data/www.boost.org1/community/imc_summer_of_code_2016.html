              IMC Summer of Code 2016
            
            
              
              Boost has participated in the Google Summer of Code program
              for a decade and is very grateful for Google's generous past
              support. This program allows college students to have a paid
              summer internship working on open source projects, giving them
              an interesting alternative to summer onsite internships.
              Because the students that work on Boost libraries tend to stay
              with the same libraries summer after summer, the continuity of
              this program is important to Boost and to the students that
              work on Boost projects.
              Boost has traditionally been a model GSoC participant
              receiving a more than average slot allocation, so we were
              caught by surprise when Google rejected our 2016 application.
              They asked us to apply again next year, but to sit out 2016 so
              to give open source projects which don't normally get awarded
              an opportunity. We understand this rationale, but this policy
              would mean no summer internships for Boost and leave students
              that have been working on Boost libraries looking for other
              alternatives for the summer of 2016.
              When IMC Financial Markets
              learned about this situation, they saw it as an opportunity to
              support the Boost community and demonstrate their commitment to
              student development and open source.
              IMC worked with Boost to create its own "Boost Summer of
              Code" program, deliberately patterned after Google's program.
              IMC also stepped up to underwrite all the costs of this program
              for the summer of 2016.
              We thank IMC for their support and community leadership.
