              Boost Formal Review Schedule
            
	    
            
              Reviews are scheduled when the review wizards approve a
		review manager and agree with the manager and author on dates.
		See Formal Review Process for more
		information.
	      
              In addition to upcoming reviews, the schedule includes
		recent reviews already completed; that helps track review
		manager assignments and libraries reviewed but not yet posted
		on the web site. There is often a lag between acceptance and
		site posting as authors address issues raised in the formal
		review.

              Review Managers
              In order for a review to proceed, a Boost member must
              volunteer to manage the review. This should be someone with
              experience with the review process and knowledge of the
              library's domain. If you would like to volunteer to become a
              review manager, please sign up on the 
              Review Manager Volunteers page, or contact Ronald Garcia
              (rxg at cs dot ubc dot ca) and John Phillips
              (johnphillipsithaca at gmail dot com).
