              Boost Library Official Maintainer Program
              Introduction
              The 
              Boost Community Maintenance Team (CMT) has identified many Boost 
              libraries still used but not maintained actively. To protect the
              reputation that Boost has cultivated over the years, as an
              organization that provides high quality open source software,
              it is critical that all libraries bundled with Boost releases
              have active and engaged maintainers. The purpose of the Boost
              Library Official Maintainer Program is to recruit companies and 
              organizations, that are likely already providing internal support, 
              to become official maintainers of those libraries already important
              to them. 
              In exchange for taking on maintenance of a library, Boost will 
              display the maintainer's logo below in the Libraries and Participants
              section.  Boost may also display the logo on the Boost github 
              and Trac sites. Maintainers are also allowed to use the Boost Official Library
              Maintainer Logo on their own sites, presentations,
              etc...
              Applying to the Program
              If you're interested in maintaining a Boost library :
              
                Read the Memorandum of
                Understanding, which outlines what's expected of
                mainainers as well as terms for leaving the program.
                Send an email to the program administrator (Alex Olivas) indicating
                which library (or libraries) you'd like to maintain.
              
              Thanks for helping out!
