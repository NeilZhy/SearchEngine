  Boost
  C++ Libraries
  
  
  ...one of the most highly
  regarded and expertly designed C++ library projects in the
  world.  Herb Sutter and Andrei
  Alexandrescu, C++
  Coding Standards
  
  
    
      
        
          
            
              Boost Moderators
            
            
              The Boost moderators are Dave Abrahams, Carl
              Daniel, Beman
              Dawes, Jeff
              Garland, Doug
              Gregor, and John
              Maddock. You can reach the moderators at boost-owner@lists.boost.org.
              Note: The boost moderators do not moderate any
              mailing lists other than the main Boost developers' list. For
              example, the boost-users list moderators are at boost-users-owner@lists.boost.org.
              The moderators of every other
              Boost list can be reached through its home page.
              Moderator Functions
              
                Monitor the mailing list to ensure dialog remains within
                the acceptable boundaries set by the discussion policy. When
                discussion strays, use private email to gently remind,
                strongly rebuke, or outright ban, as the situation
                demands.
              
              
                Approve the initial postings of new (and thus still
                moderated) members, and move members to the "Group Policy"
                posting status.
              
              
                Administer the internal operations of the Boost web site,
                the main Boost mailing list, the CVS repository, and other
                Boost administrative machinery.
              
              
                Act as an executive committee overseeing important
                administrative and policy decisions. Boost is a zero-budget
                organization with no income and no expenses, so that
                eliminates the need for most management. Technical decisions
                are worked out on the mailing list. The moderators handle the
                few remaining decisions that need a definite answer.
              
              
                Beyond the purely administrative duties, work to keep the
                Boost community vibrant and alive. That may be as simple as
                saying "thank you" to an individual member, or as complex as
                starting some major new initiative. Do whatever it
                takes!
