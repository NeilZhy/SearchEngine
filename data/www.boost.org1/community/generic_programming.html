              Introduction
              Generic programming is about generalizing software
              components so that they can be easily reused in a wide variety
              of situations. In C++, class and function templates are
              particularly effective mechanisms for generic programming
              because they make the generalization possible without
              sacrificing efficiency.
              As a simple example of generic programming, we will look at
              how one might generalize the memcpy() function of
              the C standard library. An implementation of
              memcpy() might look like the following:
              
void* memcpy(void* region1, const void* region2, size_t n)
{
  const char* first = (const char*)region2;
  const char* last = ((const char*)region2) + n;
  char* result = (char*)region1;
  while (first != last)
    *result++ = *first++;
  return result;
}
              The memcpy() function is already generalized to
              some extent by the use of void* so that the
              function can be used to copy arrays of different kinds of data.
              But what if the data we would like to copy is not in an array?
              Perhaps it is in a linked list. Can we generalize the notion of
              copy to any sequence of elements? Looking at the body of
              memcpy(), the function's minimal requirements are that it needs to
              traverse through the sequence using some sort of
              pointer, access elements pointed to, write the
              elements to the destination, and compare pointers to
              know when to stop. The C++ standard library groups requirements
              such as these into concepts, in
              this case the Input
              Iterator concept (for region2) and the Output
              Iterator concept (for region1).
              If we rewrite the memcpy() as a function
              template, and use the Input
              Iterator and Output
              Iterator concepts to describe the requirements on the
              template parameters, we can implement a highly reusable
              copy() function in the following way:
              
template <typename InputIterator, typename OutputIterator>
OutputIterator
copy(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, OutputIterator result)
{
  while (first != last)
    *result++ = *first++;
  return result;
}
              Using the generic copy() function, we can now
              copy elements from any kind of sequence, including a linked
              list that exports iterators such as std::list
              .
              
#include <list>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
  const int N = 3;
  std::vector<int> region1(N);
  std::list<int> region2;
  region2.push_back(1);
  region2.push_back(0);
  region2.push_back(3);
  
  std::copy(region2.begin(), region2.end(), region1.begin());
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
    std::cout << region1[i] << " ";
  std::cout << std::endl;
}
              Anatomy of a
              Concept
              A concept is a set of
              requirements consisting of valid expressions, associated types,
              invariants, and complexity guarantees. A type that satisfies
              the requirements is said to model
              the concept. A concept can extend the requirements of another
              concept, which is called refinement.
              
                Valid Expressions are
                C++ expressions which must compile successfully for the
                objects involved in the expression to be considered
                models of the concept.
                Associated Types are
                types that are related to the modeling type in that they
                participate in one or more of the valid expressions.
                Typically associated types can be accessed either through
                typedefs nested within a class definition for the modeling
                type, or they are accessed through a traits
                class.
                Invariants are run-time characteristics
                of the objects that must always be true, that is, the
                functions involving the objects must preserve these
                characteristics. The invariants often take the form of
                pre-conditions and post-conditions.
                Complexity Guarantees are maximum limits
                on how long the execution of one of the valid expressions
                will take, or how much of various resources its computation
                will use.
              
              The concepts used in the C++ Standard Library are documented
              at the C++ reference
              website.
              Traits
              A traits class provides a way of associating information
              with a compile-time entity (a type, integral constant, or
              address). For example, the class template 
              std::iterator_traits<T>
              looks something like this:
              
template <class Iterator>
struct iterator_traits {
  typedef ... iterator_category;
  typedef ... value_type;
  typedef ... difference_type;
  typedef ... pointer;
  typedef ... reference;
};
              The traits' value_type gives generic code the
              type which the iterator is "pointing at", while the
              iterator_category can be used to select more
              efficient algorithms depending on the iterator's
              capabilities.
              A key feature of traits templates is that they're
              non-intrusive: they allow us to associate information
              with arbitrary types, including built-in types and types
              defined in third-party libraries, Normally, traits are
              specified for a particular type by (partially) specializing the
              traits template.
              For an in-depth description of
              std::iterator_traits, see this
              page. Another very different expression of the traits idiom
              in the standard is std::numeric_limits<T>
              which provides constants describing the range and capabilities
              of numeric types.
              Tag
              Dispatching
              Tag dispatching is a way of using function overloading to
              dispatch based on properties of a type, and is often used hand
              in hand with traits classes. A good example of this synergy is
              the implementation of the 
              std::advance() function in the C++ Standard
              Library, which increments an iterator n times.
              Depending on the kind of iterator, there are different
              optimizations that can be applied in the implementation. If the
              iterator is random
              access (can jump forward and backward arbitrary distances),
              then the advance() function can simply be
              implemented with i += n, and is very efficient:
              constant time. Other iterators must be advanced in
              steps, making the operation linear in n. If the iterator is
              
              bidirectional, then it makes sense for n to be
              negative, so we must decide whether to increment or decrement
              the iterator.
              The relation between tag dispatching and traits classes is
              that the property used for dispatching (in this case the
              iterator_category) is often accessed through a
              traits class. The main advance() function uses the
              
              iterator_traits class to get the
              iterator_category. It then makes a call the the
              overloaded advance_dispatch() function. The
              appropriate advance_dispatch() is selected by the
              compiler based on whatever type the iterator_category
               resolves to, either 
              input_iterator_tag, 
              bidirectional_iterator_tag, or 
              random_access_iterator_tag. A tag is simply a class whose only purpose is to
              convey some property for use in tag dispatching and similar
              techniques. Refer to this
              page for a more detailed description of iterator tags.
              
namespace std {
  struct input_iterator_tag { };
  struct bidirectional_iterator_tag { };
  struct random_access_iterator_tag { };
  namespace detail {
    template <class InputIterator, class Distance>
    void advance_dispatch(InputIterator& i, Distance n, input_iterator_tag) {
      while (n--) ++i;
    }
    template <class BidirectionalIterator, class Distance>
    void advance_dispatch(BidirectionalIterator& i, Distance n, 
       bidirectional_iterator_tag) {
      if (n >= 0)
        while (n--) ++i;
      else
        while (n++) --i;
    }
    template <class RandomAccessIterator, class Distance>
    void advance_dispatch(RandomAccessIterator& i, Distance n, 
       random_access_iterator_tag) {
      i += n;
    }
  }
  template <class InputIterator, class Distance>
  void advance(InputIterator& i, Distance n) {
    typename iterator_traits<InputIterator>::iterator_category category;
    detail::advance_dispatch(i, n, category);
  }
}
              Adaptors
              An adaptor is a class template which builds on
              another type or types to provide a new interface or behavioral
              variant. Examples of standard adaptors are std::reverse_iterator,
              which adapts an iterator type by reversing its motion upon
              increment/decrement, and std::stack
              , which adapts a container to provide a simple stack
              interface.
              A more comprehensive review of the adaptors in the standard
              can be found here.
              Type
              Generators
              Note: The type generator concept has
              largely been superseded by the more refined notion of a
              metafunction.
              See C++
              Template Metaprogramming for an in-depth discussion of
              metafunctions.
              A type generator is a template whose only purpose is
              to synthesize a new type or types based on its template
              argument(s)[1]. The generated type is
              usually expressed as a nested typedef named, appropriately
              type. A type generator is usually used to
              consolidate a complicated type expression into a simple one.
              This example uses an old version of 
              iterator_adaptor whose design didn't allow derived
              iterator types. As a result, every adapted iterator had to be a
              specialization of iterator_adaptor itself and
              generators were a convenient way to produce those types.
              
template <class Predicate, class Iterator, 
    class Value = complicated default,
    class Reference = complicated default,
    class Pointer = complicated default,
    class Category = complicated default,
    class Distance = complicated default
         >
struct filter_iterator_generator {
    typedef iterator_adaptor<
        
        Iterator,filter_iterator_policies<Predicate,Iterator>,
        Value,Reference,Pointer,Category,Distance> type;
};
              Now, that's complicated, but producing an adapted filter
              iterator using the generator is much easier. You can usually
              just write:
              
boost::filter_iterator_generator<my_predicate,my_base_iterator>::type
              Object
              Generators
              An object generator is a function template whose only
              purpose is to construct a new object out of its arguments.
              Think of it as a kind of generic constructor. An object
              generator may be more useful than a plain constructor when the
              exact type to be generated is difficult or impossible to
              express and the result of the generator can be passed directly
              to a function rather than stored in a variable. Most Boost
              object generators are named with the prefix
              "make_", after std::make_pair(const T&, const U&).
              For example, given:
              
struct widget {
  void tweak(int);
};
std::vector<widget *> widget_ptrs;
              By chaining two standard object generators,
              std::bind2nd()
              and std::mem_fun(),
              we can easily tweak all widgets:
              
void tweak_all_widgets1(int arg)
{
   for_each(widget_ptrs.begin(), widget_ptrs.end(),
      bind2nd(std::mem_fun(&widget::tweak), arg));
}
              Without using object generators the example above would look
              like this:
              
void tweak_all_widgets2(int arg)
{
   for_each(struct_ptrs.begin(), struct_ptrs.end(),
      std::binder2nd<std::mem_fun1_t<void, widget, int> >(
          std::mem_fun1_t<void, widget, int>(&widget::tweak), arg));
}
              As expressions get more complicated the need to reduce the
              verbosity of type specification gets more compelling.
              Policy Classes
              A policy class is a template parameter used to transmit
              behavior. An example from the standard library is
              std::allocator,
              which supplies memory management behaviors to standard containers.
              Policy classes have been explored in detail by Andrei Alexandrescu in
              this
              chapter of his book, Modern C++ Design. He
              writes:
              
                In brief, policy-based class design fosters assembling a
                class with complex behavior out of many little classes
                (called policies), each of which takes care of only one
                behavioral or structural aspect. As the name suggests, a
                policy establishes an interface pertaining to a specific
                issue. You can implement policies in various ways as long as
                you respect the policy interface.
                Because you can mix and match policies, you can achieve a
                combinatorial set of behaviors by using a small core of
                elementary components.
              
              Andrei's description of policy classes suggests that their
              power is derived from granularity and orthogonality.
              Less-granular policy interfaces have been shown to work well in
              practice, though. 
              This paper describes an old version of 
              iterator_adaptor that used non-orthogonal policies.
              There is also precedent in the standard library: 
              std::char_traits, despite its name, acts as a
              policies class that determines the behaviors of 
              std::basic_string.
              Notes
              [1] Type generators
              are sometimes viewed as a workaround for the lack of
              templated typedefs in C++.
