                ANSI Store
                The full C++ Standard including TC1 corrections
                (INCITS/ISO/IEC 14882) is available as a PDF document for $18
                US. The document is certainly not a tutorial, but is
                interesting to those who care about the precise specification
                of both the language and the standard library.
                
                Book
                The full C++ Standard including TC1 corrections is also
                available in book form, list price $65 US. Since the content
                of the book is the same as the much cheaper ANSI PDF, the
                book form is only of interest to those who prefer a physical
                book, say for a school or company library.
