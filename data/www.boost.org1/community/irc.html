              Boost IRC Hangouts
            
            
              Boost users and developers spend time in various IRC
              channels to generally work together. The attendance and traffic
              of the channels varies greatly but there is usually someone
              around to chat. And many times chat about just about any topic,
              not just about the Boost C++ Libraries.
              Even though the channels are not moderated in the strict
              sense, for some there is the expectation that one should follow
              the usual Boost discussion rules of civility. This is both as a
              recognition that the Boost community is varied in age, and in
              sensibilities. So please keep your language clean. And don't be
              surprised if you find yourself reprimanded by the ops.
              Most of the channels can be found in the freenode network. But we might
              stray into efnet.
              #boost
              This is the main channel, and as such sees a good deal of
              traffic at times. Most times one can find about 80 "people"
              (there's a few bots in there) and a good representation from
              Boost developers. If you are looking for some quick help in
              getting something in Boost working this is a good place to
              go.

              #boost-soc
              When in session students and mentors participating in the
              Google Summer of Code program take their discussions here.

              ##c++
              This is rather chatty but topical, hence the ## int he name,
              C++ language discussion channel. Many of the same people who
              hang out in the #boost channel, also hang out here. But be
              warned, read about the ##c++ channel before
              jumping in.
