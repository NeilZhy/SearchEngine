              Issues
              The binary_int library, accepted in October 2005 has not yet
              been submitted to SVN. The authors are strongly encouraged to
              contact the review wizards
              The Quantitative Units library, accepted in April 2007 has
              not yet been submitted to SVN
              The Globally Unique Identifier library, accepted
              provisionally in May 2007 has not yet been submitted for
              mini-review and full acceptance
              The Time Series Library, accepted in August 2007 has not yet
              been submitted to SVN
              The Accumulators library, accepted in February 2007 is in
              SVN
              The Exception library, accepted in October 2007 is in
              SVN
              The Scope Exit review report had not been submitted by the
              review manager. John Phillips stepped in as substitute review
              manager and produced a report
              For libraries that are still waiting to get into SVN, please
              get them ready and into the repository. The developers did some
              great work making the libraries, so don't miss the chance to
              share that work with others. Also notice that the review
              process page has been updated with a section on rights and
              responsibilities of library submitters.
              For the Scope Exit review, we would like to publicly
              apologize to Alexander Nasonov for how long this has languished
              without a report. The review wizards will work to make sure
              this doesn't happen any more.
            
            
              General Announcements
              As always, we need experienced review managers. In the past
              few months there have been a large number of reviews, but the
              flow of high quality submissions is just as big, so manage
              reviews if possible and if not please make sure to watch the
              review schedule and participate. Please take a look at the list
              of libraries in need of managers and check out their
              descriptions. In general review managers are active boost
              participants or library contributors. If you can serve as
              review manager for any of them, email Ron Garcia or John
              Phillips, "garcia at cs dot indiana dot edu" and "phillips at
              mps dot ohio-state dot edu" respectively.
              A link to this report will be posted to www.boost.org. If
              you would like us to make any modifications or additions to
              this report before we do that, please email Ron or John.
              If you're a library author and plan on submitting a library
              for review in the next 3-6 months, send Ron or John a short
              description of your library and we'll add it to the Libraries
              Under Construction below. We know that there are many libraries
              that are near completion, but we have hard time keeping track
              all of them. Please keep us informed about your progress.

                      Description:
                      
                        The Boost.FSM library is an
                        implementation of FSM (stands for Finite State
                        Machine) programming concept. The main goals of the
                        library are:
                        
                          Simplicity. It should be very simple to create
                          state machines using this library.
                          Performance. The state machine infrastructure
                          should not be very time and memory-consuming in
                          order to be applicable in more use cases.
                          Extensibility. A developer may want to add more
                          states to an existing state machine. A developer
                          should also be able to specify additional
                          transitions and events for the machine with minimum
                          modifications to the existing code.

                        A number of additions and
                        modifications to the Property Map Library,
                        including:
                        
                          A constant-valued property map, useful for
                          naturally unweighted graphs.
                          A noop-writing property map, useful when you
                          have to provide an argument, but just don't care
                          about the output.
                          See 
                          ChangeLog for details.

                      Description:
                      
                        A number of additions and
                        modifications to the Graph Library, including:
                        
                          Two new graph classes (undirected and directed)
                          which are intended to make the library more
                          approachable for new developers
                          A suite of graph measures including degree and
                          closeness centrality, mean geodesic distance,
                          eccentricity, and clustering coefficients.
                          An algorithm for visiting all cycles in a
                          directed graph (Tiernan's from 1970ish). It works
                          for undirected graphs too, but reports cycles twice
                          (one for each direction).
                          An algorithm for visiting all the cliques a
                          graph (Bron&Kerbosch). Works for both directed
                          and undirected.
                          Derived graph measures radius and diameter
                          (from eccentricity) and girth and circumference
                          (from Tiernan), and clique number (from
                          Bron&Kerbosch).
                          An exterior_property class that helps hides
                          some of the weirdness with exterior
                          properties.
                          run-time and compile-time tests for the new
                          algorithms.
                          a substantial amount of documentation
                          Graph cores, implemented by David Gleich
                          (@Stanford University)
                          Deterministic graph generators - capable of
                          creating or inducing specific types of graphs over
                          a vertex set (e.g., star graph, wheel graph, prism
                          graph, etc). There are several other specific types
                          that could be added to this, but I haven't had the
                          time just yet.

                      Description:
                      Smart pointers are in general
                      optimized for a specific resource (memory usage, CPU
                      cycles, user friendliness, ...) depending on what the
                      user need to make the most of. The purpose of this
                      smart pointer is mainly to allocate the reference
                      counter (or owner) and the object itself at the same
                      time so that dynamic memory management is simplified
                      thus accelerated and cheaper on the memory map.

                      Description:
                      Dataflow is a generic library
                      for dataflow programming. Dataflow programs can
                      typically be expressed as a graph in which vertices
                      represent components that process data, and edges
                      represent the flow of data between the components. As
                      such, dataflow programs can be easily reconfigured by
                      changing the components and/or the connections.

                      Used properly, logging is a very
                      powerful tool. Besides aiding debugging/testing, it can
                      also show you how your application is used. The Boost
                      Logging Library allows just for that, supporting a lot
                      of scenarios, ranging from very simple (dumping all to
                      one destination), to very complex (multiple logs, some
                      enabled/some not, levels, etc). It features a very
                      simple and flexible interface, efficient filtering of
                      messages, thread-safety, formatters and destinations,
                      easy manipulation of logs, finding the best
                      logger/filter classes based on your application's
                      needs, you can define your own macros and much
                      more!

                      implementations, proposals, and academic papers

                      Description:
                      
                        This paper proposes a kind of return
                        buffer that takes a value (or an exception) in one
                        (sub-)thread and provides the value in another
                        (controlling) thread. This buffer provides
                        essentially two interfaces:
                        
                          
                            an interface to assign a value as class
                            promise and
                            an interface to wait for, query and retrieve
                            the value (or exception) from the buffer as
                            classes unique_future and shared_future. While a
                            unique_future provides move semantics where the
                            value (or exception) can be retrieved only once,
                            the shared_future provides copy semantics where
                            the value can be retrieved arbitrarily
                            often.
                          
                        
                        A typical procedure for working with promises and
                        futures looks like:
                        
                          
                            control thread creates a promise,
                            control thread gets associated future from
                            promise,
                            control thread starts sub-thread,
                            sub-thread calls actual function and assigns
                            the return value to the promise,
                            control thread waits for future to become
                            ready,
                            control thread retrieves value from
                            future.
                          
                        
                        Also proposed is a packaged_task that wraps one
                        callable object and provides another one that can be
                        started in its own thread and assigns the return
                        value (or exception) to a return buffer that can be
                        accessed through one of the future classes.
                        With a packaged_task a typical procedure looks
                        like:
                        
                          
                            control thread creates a packaged_task with a
                            callable object,
                            control thread gets associated future from
                            packaged_task,
                            control thread starts sub-thread, which
                            invokes the packaged_task,
                            packaged_task calls the callable function and
                            assigns the return value,
                            control thread waits for future to become
                            ready,
                            control thread retrieves value from
                            future.
                          
                        
                      
                    
                  
                
                Notice that we are in the unusual position of having two
                very different libraries with the same goal in the queue at
                the same time. The Review Wizards would appreciate a
                discussion of the best way to hold these two reviews to
                produce the best possible addition to Boost.

                      Join is an asynchronous, message
                      based C++ concurrency library based on join calculus.
                      It is applicable both to multi-threaded applications
                      and to the orchestration of asynchronous, event-based
                      applications. It follows Comega's design and
                      implementation and builds with Boost facilities. It
                      provides a high level concurrency API with asynchronous
                      methods, synchronous methods, and chords which are
                      "join-patterns" defining the synchronization,
                      asynchrony, and concurrency.

                      The Pimpl idiom is a simple yet
                      robust technique to minimize coupling via the
                      separation of interface and implementation and then
                      implementation hiding. This library provides a
                      convenient yet flexible and generic deployment
                      technique for the Pimpl idiom. It's seemingly complete
                      and broadly applicable, yet minimal, simple and
                      pleasant to use.
