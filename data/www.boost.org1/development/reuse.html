              Boost Library reuse: cost versus benefit trade-offs
            
            
              A Boost library should not use libraries
              other than Boost or the C++ Standard Library.
              A Boost library should use other Boost
              Libraries or the C++ Standard Library, but only when the
              benefits outweigh the costs.
              The benefits of using components from other libraries may
              include clearer, more understandable code, reduced development
              and maintenance costs, and the assurance which comes from
              reusing well-known and trusted building blocks.
              The costs may include undesirable coupling between
              components, and added compilation and runtime costs. If the
              interface to the additional component is complex, using it may
              make code less readable, and thus actually increase development
              and maintenance costs.
              Negative effects of coupling become obvious when one library
              uses a second library which uses a third, and so on. The worst
              form of coupling requires the user understand each of the
              coupled libraries. Coupling may also reduce the portability of
              a library - even in case when all used libraries are
              self-sufficient (see example of questionable usage of
              <iostream> library below).
              Example where another boost component should
              certainly be used: boost::noncopyable (in boost/utility.hpp)
              has considerable benefits; it simplifies code, improves
              readability, and signals intent. Costs are low as coupling is
              limited; noncopyable itself uses no other classes and its
              header includes only the lightweight headers
              <boost/config.hpp> and <cstddef>. There are no
              runtime costs at all. With costs so low and benefits so high,
              other boost libraries should use boost::noncopyable when the
              need arises except in exceptional circumstances.
              Example where a standard library component might
              possibly be used: Providing diagnostic output as a
              debugging aid can be a nice feature for a library. Yet using
              Standard Library <iostream> can involve a lot of
              additional cost, particularly if <iostream> is unlikely
              to be used elsewhere in the application. In certain GUI or
              embedded applications, coupling to <iostream> would be a
              disqualification. Consider redesign of the boost library in
              question so that the user supplies the diagnostic output
              mechanism.
              Example where another boost component should not be
              used: The boost dir_it library has considerable
              coupling and runtime costs, not to mention portability issues
              for unsupported operating systems. While completely appropriate
              when directory iteration is required, it would not be
              reasonable for another boost library to use dir_it just to
              check that a file is available before opening. C++ Standard
              Library file open functionality does this at lower cost. Don't
              use dir_it just for the sake of using a boost library.
