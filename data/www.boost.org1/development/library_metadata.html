              Library Metadata
            
            
              A module can contain an optional file which describes the
              libraries that it contains. This is located at
              meta/libraries.json. It either contains a single
              json object for a single library, or a list or json objects for
              any number of libraries.
              For example, for a single library:
              
{
    "key": "unordered",
    "name": "Unordered",
    "authors": [ "Daniel James" ],
    "maintainers": [ "Daniel James <dnljms -at- gmail.com>" ],
    "description": "Unordered associative containers.",
    "std": [ "tr1" ],
    "category": [
        "Containers"
    ]
}
              An example for multiple libraries:
              
[
    {
        "key": "functional",
        "name": "Functional",
        "authors": [ "Mark Rodgers" ],
        "description": "The Boost.Function library contains a family of class templates that are function object wrappers.",
        "category": [
            "Function-objects"
        ]
    },
    {
        "key": "functional/factory",
        "name": "Functional/Factory",
        "authors": [ "Tobias Schwinger" ],
        "maintainers": [ "Tobias Schwinger <tschwinger -at- isonews2.com>" ],
        "description": "Function object templates for dynamic and static object creation",
        "documentation": "factory/",
        "category": [
            "Function-objects"
        ]
    },
]
              Json fields
              key
              This is a unique identifier for the library, typically the
              path to it from the libs directory.
              name
              Human readable name of the library
              status
              Used for libraries with special statuses, currently can have
              value deprecated for deprecated libraries, and
              hidden for libraries which shouldn't be displayed to
              the user.
              authors
              Either a string, or a list of strings, containing the names
              of the authors
              description
              A brief description of what the library does
              category
              A list of categories that the library belongs to, the full
              list is below.
              documentation
              Path to the documentation, defaults to the root of the
              module.
              std
              A list of the standardization status of the library.
              Currently just supports 'tr1' for included in TR1 and
              'proposal' for a current proposal. Will add more in the
              future..
