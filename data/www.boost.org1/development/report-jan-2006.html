              News
              Happy New Year! Here are some statistics regarding Boost
              Library reviews in 2005:
              
                12 Libraries were reviewed
                8 Libraries were accepted
                1 Library (Function Types) was accepted pending a
                mini-review
                2 Libraries were rejected
                1 Library has yet to receive a final verdict (ASIO)
              
              Policy Pointer has been removed from the review queue
              because the author has stated that it is not quite ready.
              We need review managers. Please take a look at the list of
              libraries in need of managers and check out their descriptions.
              If you can serve as review manager for any of them, send one of
              us an email.
              
                Note:
                If you have any suggestions about how we could improve
                the Review Wizard's status report, please email "reportbase
                at gmail dot com" and "garcia at cs dot indiana dot
                edu".
              
              Review Managers Needed
              There are a few libraries in the review queue in need of
              review managers. If you would like to volunteer to be a review
              manager, please contact Ron or Tom.
              The following libraries still require review managers:

                    Description:
                    The fixed string library provides
                    buffer overrun protection for static sized strings (char
                    s[ n ]). It provides a C-style string interface for
                    compatibility with C code (for example, porting a C
                    program to C++). There is also a std::string-style
                    interface using a class based on flex_string by Andre
                    Alexandrescu with a few limitations due to the
                    non-resizable nature of the class.

                    Description:
                    While intrusive containers were
                    and are widely used in C, they became more and more
                    forgotten in the C++-world due to the presence of the
                    standard containers, which don't support intrusive
                    techniques. Boost.Intrusive not only reintroduces this
                    technique to C++, but also encapsulates the
                    implementation in STL-like interfaces. Hence anyone
                    familiar with standard containers can use intrusive
                    containers with ease.

                        This library provides a metaprogramming
                        facility
                        
                          to classify, decompose and
                          synthesize function-, function pointer-, function
                          reference- and member function pointer types. For
                          the purpose of this documentation, these types are
                          collectively referred to as function types (this
                          differs from the standard definition and redefines
                          the term from a programmer's perspective to refer
                          to the most common types that involve
                          functions).
                        
                        The classes introduced by this library
                        
                          shall conform to the concepts
                          of the Boost Metaprogramming library (MPL).
                        
                        The Function Types library enables the user
                        to:
                        
                          
                            test an arbitrary type for being a function
                            type of specified kind,
                            inspect properties of function types,
                            view and modify sub types of an encapsulated
                            function type with MPL Sequence operations,
                            and
                            synthesize function types.
                          
                        
                        This library supports variadic functions and
                        
                          can be configured to support
                          non-default calling conventions.

                      Shmem offers tools to simplify shared
                      memory usage in applications. These include shared
                      memory creation/destruction and synchronization
                      objects. It also implements dynamic allocation of
                      portions of a shared memory segment and an easy way to
                      construct C++ objects in shared memory.
                      Apart from this, Shmem implements a
                      wide range of STL-like containers and allocators that
                      can be safely placed in shared memory, helpful to
                      implement complex shared memory data-bases and other
                      efficient inter-process communications.

                      Fusion is a library of heterogenous
                      containers and views and algorithms. A set of
                      heterogenous containers (vector, list, set and map) is
                      provided out of the box along with view classes that
                      present various composable views over the data. The
                      containers and views follow a common sequence concept
                      with an underlying iterator concept that binds it all
                      together, suitably making the algorithms fully generic
                      over all sequence types.
                      The architecture is somewhat modeled
                      after MPL which in turn is modeled after STL. It is
                      code-named "fusion" because the library is the "fusion"
                      of compile time metaprogramming with runtime
                      programming.

                    Description:
                    The pimpl idiom is widely used to
                    reduce compile times and disable code coupling. It does
                    so by moving private parts of a class from the .hpp file
                    to the .cpp file. However, it's implementation can be
                    tricky, and with many pitfalls (especially regarding
                    memory management). The pimpl_ptr library is a single
                    header file, implementing a special policy based smart
                    pointer to greately ease the implementation of the pimpl
                    idiom.

                      Proposal to add promote,
                      integral_promotion and floating_point_promotion class
                      templates to type_traits library.
                      Alexander tried it on different compilers with
                      various success: GNU/Linux (gentoo-hardened): gcc 3.3
                      and 3.4, Intel 7, 8 and 9 Windows: VC7 free compiler
                      Sparc Solaris: Sun C++ 5.3 and 5.7
                      See comments at the beginning of
                      promote_enum_test.cpp for what is broken.

                      Alexander requests a fast-track
                      review.
