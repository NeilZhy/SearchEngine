              Website Exemplars
            
            
              This is both a test page and a guide as to the various
              styled elements available in the Boost web pages. And for self
              reference this is a [class="section-body"] div inside a
              [class="section"] div. Each [class="section"] div should have a
              corresponding "id", in this case the section is [id="intro"].
              Feel free to copy elements from here onto other pages to
              quickly get the structure you want. And of more import
              please update this page if you add new content styles as it
              helps everyone with the website documentation.
            
          
        
        
          
            
              Section [class="section-title"]
            
            
              Simple paragraph inside the section body
              [class="section-body"].
              Heading 2
              The image to the
              left uses a [class="left-inset"] as a shorthand for any
              floating inset element aligned at both top and left edges.

              for a floating inset element aligned to top and right edges.

              These are, hopefully all, the standard text markup styles.
              Note, these are not structural markup elements. I.e.
              these are the styles one sees to mark parts of the text inside
              a paragraph, like the "not" in the second sentence of this
              paragraph.

              Heading 5
              There are a variety of HTML structural elements. This means
              that they do not tipically show with text flow. Bu tinstead
              show as individual block elements. This paragraph being an
              example. And the somewhat overused BLOCKQUOTE being
              another:

              The Boost pages avoid the use of tables as a layout
              mechanism. This helps, and hurts, in a variety of ways. The
              most important benefit is the wider semantic access of the
              content. It means that the largest set of browsers will
              interpret tables as what they are; tabular content. The
              following convenient sample comes from the helpful HTML4 W3 standard:

              Heading 6
              One of the most important elements of HTML is the hypertext
              link. In the Boost pages all links are treated
              in a similar, consistent, manner regardless of context as much
              as possible. Stylistic variations are present to account for
              color contrast differences in the context. For example the
              links in the header, and footer use different colors to match
              the text color and contrast as much as possible with the
              respective backgrounds. Within section content, like here, the
              links also provide differing look & feel based on wether
              they target the Boost web site, or some
              external web
              site [class="external"]. Since most of the time links are
              internal, that is the default semantic. External links need to
              be decorated with [class="external"].
              
                
                  One
                  This a "directory" unordered list [ul
                  class="directory"]. It is styled to show a list of short
                  items in as compact a form as possible. Currently that
                  means the items are arrayed in two columns and items are
                  packed to read left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
                
                
                  Two
                  Even though this an unordered list, one can also arrange
                  any block elements in this way. The top container needs to
                  be a [class="directory"] and the interior items
                  [class="directory-item"].
                
              
              Unordered Lists [ul]
              This type of list is one of the most commonly used
              structural elements used. It's used for directory listing,
              history listings, table of contests, and many more. The goal is
              to classify the various lists by type with a
              [class="type-here"] attribute on the list [ul]. Please resist
              the urge to use a classification just because it has the
              particular look you want. As at some future point the look will
              change and you will have no say in the effect of the particular
              context.
              Default [ul]
              
                Item 1
