              Content
              The website content lives in the git repository.
              In progress work is on the beta branch, the
              live website is on the master branch. The website
              is updated automatically from the git repo. If you want to
              update the website, please create a pull request.
              Existing
              Page
              Large sections of the site are automatically generated, this
              includes the release notes, the news pages and any files in the
              generated directory. If you wish to edit these, see below.
              The web content is structured to be as simple as possible to
              make generic editing possible. At minimum only a text editor
              and HTML Tidy are needed to edit
              content. The content uses XHTML 1.0 Strict for various
              reasons, the most important being to increase accessibility and
              to enforce the separation of style from content. After getting
              the content you want to edit as above, make the changes you
              want and run the result through HTML Tidy with these
              options:
              
tidy --tidy-mark no -i -wrap 78 -m -asxhtml --merge-divs no --merge-spans no --doctype strict fname
              Running HTML Tidy with a consistent set of options also
              helps in keeping an accurate change history in the repository.
              There are examples of
              the kinds of styles supported either directly or through the
              use of [class="value"] attributes for the
              various XHTML tags. Please pay attention to any errors and
              warnings that HTML Tidy mentions and strive to remove all of
              them.
              NOTE: The options for tidy are for
              the latest version. In particular the --merge-*
              options may not be available in the version that comes as part
              of many Unix/Linux distributions, and Windows utilities.
              Removing the unavailable options is possible and will work. But
              we recommend installing the latest tidy if possible.
              You can obtain up to date Windows binaries, and sources from
              the HTML Tidy Library
              Project.
              The pages should be viewable in most browsers. If possible
              test you changes in as many as possible. Preferably at least
              with IE and one other modern browser if you are on Windows. But
              if you are on another platform testing with the "default"
              browser is best. Normally viewing the page in outside of the a
              web server context will only show you the content and part of
              the footer. This is because the site uses Server Side Includes
              (SSI) which most browsers will not process. To look at the
              complete content you will need to either run your own Apache
              server, or commit the changes and view the changes online
              at:

                    website. Development work should be done here first and
                    then merged to the live website.

                    see.
                  
                
              
              New Page
              To make adding new pages easier there is a template to get one
              started. There are also _template_.html files in
              the various site sections which already include the correct
              sidebar menus. To start, copy the template to the section of
              the website you want to add to and name the new file with a
              reasonably clear name. The section is up to you but the
              intended type of content for each is:
              
                Introduction
                Content to help new users understand what Boost is for
                and what it is about. This is the one place where new
                visitors are going to visit. Directory: /users
                Community
                For users who are interested in participating, or are
                already participitating, this section describes how the Boost
                community of users and developers functions. Directory:
                /community
                Development
                Prospective or existing Boost developers make use of this
                section to quickly get to the most frequetly used content.
                This section is intended to hold the references to resources
                or directly include content that changes frequently. Or
                content that only pertains to library developers, although it
                may be of more widespread interest as users become more
                involved in the Boost community. Directory:
                /development
                Documentation
                This section organizes documents specific to the Boost
                libraries. This includes at minimum the library documentation
                published with each of the Boost releases. Also included is
                access to the community maintained Wiki. Directory:
                /doc
              
              To provide the section user interface look and feel there
              are some changes that need to be done to the template:
              
                
                  Each section has a different CSS style reference
                  included in the head section. This reference needs
                  to change to one of:
                  
                    Introduction:
                    /style-v2/section-boost.css
                    Community:
                    /style-v2/section-community.css
                    Development:
                    /style-v2/section-development.css
                    Support: /style-v2/section-support.css
                    Documentation:
                    /style-v2/section-doc.css
                  
                
                
                  Each section displays a different context sensitive
                  sidebar menu through the use of SSI. The reference to the
                  sidebar to display needs to change in the sidebar
                  section to one of:
                  
                    Introduction:
                    /common/sidebar-boost.html
                    Community:
                    /common/sidebar-community.html
                    Development:
                    /common/sidebar-development.html
                    Support: /common/sidebar-support.html
                    Documentation: /common/sidebar-doc.html
                  
                  In the sidebar section there are two menus
                  included the first is common to all the pages and contains
                  the download link and search box. Do not replace that
                  sidebar (/common/sidebar-common.html). It's the
                  second #include that should be changed to reflect
                  the current section.
                
                
                  Since this is a new page, you will also need to insert
                  your own corresponding copyright in the footer.
                
                
                  To insert the new content you need to insert it into the
                  section-body section. Replace the {stuff}
                  placeholder with the content you want. In addition you
                  might also want to change the title, in the head,
                  and in the section-title section.
                
              
              In addition to the immediate content for the new page one
              needs to add an entry to the page so it can be accessed from
              the sidebar and index. See below...
              Menus, Sidebars, and
              Index
              The various navigation elements are structured to make
              adding new entries easy and to keep all places where wuch
              entries show consistent. To do this the site makes use of SSI
              to reduce the locations that have those entries to
              one. This means that changing it at the single common
              place one doesn't have to worry about changing all the pages,
              they all reflect the new content immediately. To add items to
              the various section menus edit the corresponding menu file in
              the website/common directory:
              
                Introduction: /common/menu-boost.html
                Community: /common/menu-community.html
                Development: /common/menu-development.html
                Documentation: /generated/menu-doc.html
              
              Generated Pages
              There are various sections of the web site that are
              generated by a php script from quickbook source files: the home
              page, news, downloads, version history and feeds. The content
              is not directly editable, but instead is generated from source
              Quickbook documents. For example, to add a news item one
              would:
              
                Create a new file in the /feed/news directory,
                say /feed/news/gui_review_ends.qbk.
                In a shell, run the /site-tools/update.py
                script. This will generate the page for the new news item,
                regenerate the /feed/news.rss file to include it,
                update pages which link to the new item and update the file
                /site-tools/state/feed-pages.txt which tracks the
                current state of generated files.
                Add the new files to the SVN repository, and commit.
              
              The same procedure applies to the other feeds, but keep in
              mind that some feeds may combine entries from more than one
              feed subdirectory. Currently this requires Quickbook and Python
              in your path.
              Local
              Server
              Even though the web site is designed so that one only needs
              some basic tools and a web browser to make changes there are
              some aspects that are dynamic and hence will not work without
              an accompanying web server. To set up local web server for
              doing changes to the dynamic content one needs to:
              
                
                  Install and get working Apache 2.x. and PHP 5.3 or later (install PHP as an
                  Apache module, not as CGI).
                
                
                  Set up a symbolic host lookup in your hosts
                  file by adding "127.0.0.1 boost.localhost".
                
                
                  Add a virtual host in Apache to match the new local
                  host. A likely configuration to work is:
                  
<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
  ServerName boost.localhost
  DocumentRoot "/path/to/boost/website/public_html/beta"
  <Directory "/path/to/boost/website/public_html/beta">
    Options +MultiViews +Includes +ExecCGI +FollowSymLinks +Includes
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    # For apache 2.4:
    # Require all granted
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
                
                
                  Create a local PHP configuration file for Boost specific
                  settings as
                  "/path/to/boost/website/public_html/beta/common/code/boost_config_local.php"
                  that contains something like:
                  
<?php
define('BOOST_WEBSITE_SHARED_DIR', '/path/to/boost/website/workplace');
define('ARCHIVE_DIR', '/path/to/boost/website/workplace/archives');
define('RESULTS_DIR', '/path/to/boost/website/workplace/testing');
define('UNZIP', 'unzip');
?>
                  For a brief explanation of the settings see the
                  
                  common/code/boost_config.php file.
                
                
                  In order to view the documentation, or the build
                  sub-site, you'll need to setup the appropriate directories.
                  ARCHIVE_DIR needs to be the location of unzipped
                  copies of the appropriate boost distribution to serve the
                  documentation. /build needs to contain the
                  
                  website branch of Boost.Build. A soft link to
                  another directory can be used here (which is how it's done
                  on the server).
                
              
              Ubuntu setup
              To setup the site on Ubuntu, I needed to do:
              
sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2enmod include
sudo a2dismod deflate
sudo service apache2 restart
              
              I had to disable deflate because it interacts
              badly with php's virtual function.
