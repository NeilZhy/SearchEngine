              Running Boost Regression Tests
            
            
              Running Regression Tests Locally
            
            
              It's easy to run regression tests on your Boost
              clone.
              To run a library's regression tests, run Boost's
              b2 utility from the
              <boost-root>/libs/<library>/test directory. To run a
              single test, specify its name (as found in 
              <boost-root>/libs/<library>/test/Jamfile.v2) on the
              command line.
              See the Getting
              Started guide for help building or downloading
              bjam for your platform, and navigating your Boost
              distribution.
              To run every library's regression tests, run b2
              from <boost-root>/status directory.
              To run Boost.Build's regression tests, run "python
              test_all.py" from <boost-root>/tools/build/v2/test
              directory. (Python 2.3  version < 3.0 required.)
            
            
              Running Boost's Automated Regression and Reporting
            
            
              This runs all Boost regression tests and reports the results back to
              the Boost community.
              Requirements
              
                Python (2.3  version < 3.0).
                Git (recent version).
                At least 5 gigabytes of disk space per compiler to be
                tested.
              
              Step by step instructions
              
                Create a new directory for the branch you want to
                test.
                Download the 
                run.py script into that directory:
                
                
                
                
                  Open 
                  run.py script in your browser.
                  Click the Raw button. 
                  Save as run.py in the directory you just created.
                
                
                
                  Run "python run.py options... [commands]"
                  with these three required options, plus any others you wish to employ:
                  
                    --runner= - Your choice of name that
                    identifies your results in the reports 1, 2.
                    --toolsets= - The toolset(s) you want to test
                    with 3.
                    
                    --tag= - The tag (i.e. branch) you want to test.
                    The only tages that currently make sense are
                    develop and master.
                                        
                  
                  For example:python run.py --runner=Metacomm
                  --toolsets=gcc-4.2.1,msvc-8.0 --tag=develop
                
              
              
              Note: If you are behind a firewall/proxy
              server, everything should still "just work". In the rare cases
              when it doesn't, you can explicitly specify the proxy server
              parameters through the --proxy option, e.g.:
              python run.py ... --proxy=http://www.someproxy.com:3128
              Options
              commands: cleanup, collect-logs, get-source, get-tools, patch, regression,
setup, show-revision, test, test-boost-build, test-clean, test-process, test-
run, update-source, upload-logs

  --toolsets=TOOLSETS   comma-separated list of toolsets to test with
  --libraries=LIBRARIES
                        comma separated list of libraries to test
  --incremental         do incremental run (do not remove previous binaries)

              To test develop use "--tag=develop",
              and to test master use
              "--tag=master". Or substitute any Boost
              tree of your choice.
              Details
              The regression run procedure will:
              
                Download the most recent regression scripts.
                Download the designated testing tool sources including
                Boost.Jam, Boost.Build, and the various regression
                programs.
                Download the most recent from the Boost Git Repository
                into the subdirectory boost.
                Build b2 and process_jam_log if
                needed. (process_jam_log is a utility, which
                extracts the test results from the log file produced by
                Boost.Build).
                Run regression tests, process and collect the
                results.
                Upload the results to a common FTP server.
              
              The report merger process running continuously will merge
              all submitted test runs and publish them at various locations.
              Advanced use
              Providing detailed information about your environment
              Once you have your regression results displayed in the
              Boost-wide reports, you may consider providing a bit more
              information about yourself and your test environment. This
              additional information will be presented in the reports on a
              page associated with your runner ID.
              By default, the page's content is just a single line coming
              from the comment.html file in your run.py
              directory, specifying the tested platform. You can put online a
              more detailed description of your environment, such as your
              hardware configuration, compiler builds, and test schedule, by
              simply altering the file's content. Also, please consider
              providing your name and email address for cases where Boost
              developers have questions specific to your particular set of
              results.
              Incremental runs
              You can run run.py in incremental mode by simply passing it an
              identically named command-line flag:
              python run.py ... --incremental
              Patching Boost sources
              You might encounter an occasional need to make local
              modifications to the Boost codebase before running the tests,
              without disturbing the automatic nature of the regression
              process. To implement this under regression.py:
              
                Codify applying the desired modifications to the sources
                located in the ./boost_root subdirectory in a single
                executable script named patch_boost
                (patch_boost.bat on Windows).
                Place the script in the run.py directory.
              
              The driver will check for the existence of the
              patch_boost script, and, if found, execute it after
              obtaining the Boost sources.
              Feedback
              Please send all comments/suggestions regarding this document
              and the testing procedure itself to the Boost Testing list.
              Notes
              [1] If you are
              running regressions interlacingly with a different set of
              compilers (e.g. for Intel in the morning and GCC at the end of
              the day), you need to provide a different runner id
              for each of these runs, e.g. your_name-intel, and
              your_name-gcc.
              [2] The limitations
              of the reports' format/medium impose a direct dependency
              between the number of compilers you are testing with and the
              amount of space available for your runner id. If you are
              running regressions for a single compiler, please make sure to
              choose a short enough id that does not significantly disturb
              the reports' layout. You can also use spaces in the runner ID
              to allow the reports to wrap the name to fit.
              [3] If
              --toolsets option is not provided, the script will try
              to use the platform's default toolset (gcc for most
              Unix-based systems).
              [4] By default,
              the script runs in what is known as full mode: on each
              run.py invocation all the files that were left in
              place by the previous run  including the binaries for
              the successfully built tests and libraries  are deleted,
              and everything is rebuilt once again from scratch. By contrast,
              in incremental mode the already existing binaries are
              left intact, and only the tests and libraries which source
              files has changed since the previous run are re-built and
              re-tested.
              The main advantage of incremental runs is a significantly
              shorter turnaround time, but unfortunately they don't always
              produce reliable results. Some type of changes to the codebase
              (changes to the b2 testing subsystem in particular) often
              require switching to a full mode for one cycle in order to
              produce trustworthy reports.
              As a general guideline, if you can afford it, testing in
              full mode is preferable.
