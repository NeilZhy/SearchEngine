Motivation
Suppose we have a class
struct X
{
  X ( int, std:::string ) ;
} ;
And a container for it which supports an empty state (that is, which can contain zero objects):
struct C
{
   C() : contained_(0) {}
  ~C() { delete contained_ ; }
  X* contained_ ;
} ;
A container designed to support an empty state typically doesn't require the contained type to be DefaultConstructible,
but it typically requires it to be CopyConstructible as a mechanism to
initialize the object to store:
struct C
{
   C() : contained_(0) {}
   C ( X const& v ) : contained_ ( new X(v) ) {}
  ~C() { delete contained_ ; }
  X* contained_ ;
} ;
There is a subtle problem with this: since the mechanism used to initialize the stored object is copy construction,
there must exist a previously constructed source object to copy from. This
object is likely to be temporary and serve no purpose besides being the source
void foo()
{
  // Temporary object created.
  C c( X(123,"hello") ) ;
}
A solution to this problem is to support direct construction of the contained
object right in the container's storage.
In this scheme, the user supplies the arguments for the X constructor
directly to the container:
struct C
{
   C() : contained_(0) {}
   C ( X const& v ) : contained_ ( new X(v) ) {}
   C ( int a0, std::string a1 ) : contained_ ( new X(a0,a1) ) {}
  ~C() { delete contained_ ; }
  X* contained_ ;
} ;
void foo()
{
  // Wrapped object constructed in-place
  // No temporary created.
  C c(123,"hello") ;
}
Clearly, this solution doesn't scale well since the container must duplicate all the constructor overloads from the contained type
(at least all those which are to be supported directly in the container).
Framework
This library proposes a framework to allow some containers to directly contruct contained objects in-place without requiring
the entire set of constructor overloads from the contained type. It also allows the container to remove the CopyConstuctible
requirement from the contained type since objects can be directly constructed in-place without need of a copy.
The only requirement on the container is that it must provide proper storage (that is, correctly aligned and sized).
Naturally, the container will typically support uninitialized storage to avoid the in-place construction to override
a fully-constructed object (as this would defeat the purpose of in-place construction)
For this purpose, the framework provides two families of classes collectively called: InPlaceFactories and TypedInPlaceFactories.
Essentially, these classes hold a sequence of actual parameters and a method to contruct an object in place using these parameters.
Each member of the family differs only in the number (and type) of the parameter list. The first family
takes the type of the object to construct directly in method provided for that
purpose, whereas the second family incorporates that type in the factory class
itself..
From the container POV, using the framework amounts to calling the factory's method to contruct the object in place.
From the user POV, it amounts to creating the right factory object to hold the parameters and pass it to the container.
The following simplified example shows the basic idea. A complete example follows the formal specification of the framework:
struct C
{
   template<class InPlaceFactory>
   C ( InPlaceFactory const& aFactory )
    :
    contained_ ( uninitialized_storage() )
   {
     aFactory.template apply<X>(contained_);
   }
  ~C() 
  { 
    contained_ -> X::~X();
    delete[] contained_ ; 
  }
  char* uninitialized_storage() { return new char[sizeof(X)] ; }
  char* contained_ ;
} ;
void foo()
{
  C c( in_place(123,"hello") ) ;
}
Specification
The following is the first member of the family of 'in_place_factory' classes, along with its corresponding helper template function.
The rest of the family varies only in the number and type of template (and constructor) parameters.
namespace boost {
struct in_place_factory_base {} ;
template<class A0>
class in_place_factory : public in_place_factory_base
{
  public:
    in_place_factory ( A0 const& a0 ) : m_a0(a0) {}
    template< class T >
    void apply ( void* address ) const
    {
      new (address) T(m_a0);
    }
  private:
    A0 const& m_a0 ;
} ;
template<class A0>
in_place_factory<A0> in_place ( A0 const& a0 )
{
  return in_place_factory<A0>(a0);
}
Similarly, the following is the first member of the family of 'typed_in_place_factory' classes, along with its corresponding
helper template function. The rest of the family varies only in the number and type of template (and constructor) parameters.
namespace boost {
struct typed_in_place_factory_base {} ;
template<class T, class A0>
class typed_in_place_factory : public typed_in_place_factory_base
{
  public:
    typed_in_place_factory ( A0 const& a0 ) : m_a0(a0) {}
    void apply ( void* address ) const
    {
      new (address) T(m_a0);
    }
  private:
    A0 const& m_a0 ;
} ;
template<class T, class A0>
typed_in_place_factory<A0> in_place ( A0 const& a0 )
{
  return typed_in_place_factory<T,A0>(a0);
}
}
As you can see, the 'in_place_factory' and 'typed_in_place_factory' template classes varies only in the way they specify
the target type: in the first family, the type is given as a template argument to the apply member function while in the
second it is given directly as part of the factory class.
When the container holds a unique non-polymorphic type (such as the case of Boost.Optional), it knows the exact dynamic-type
of the contained object and can pass it to the apply() method of a (non-typed) factory.
In this case, end users can use an 'in_place_factory' instance which can be constructed without the type of the object to construct.
However, if the container holds heterogeneous or polymorphic objects (such as the case of Boost.Variant), the dynamic-type
of the object to be constructed must be known by the factory itslef. In this case, end users must use a 'typed_in_place_factory'
instead.
Container-side Usage
As shown in the introductory simplified example, the container class must
contain methods that accept an instance of
these factories and pass the object's storage to the factory's apply method.
However, the type of the factory class cannot be completly specified in the container class because that would
defeat the whole purpose of the factories which is to allow the container to accept a variadic argument list
for the constructor of its contained object.
The correct function overload must be based on the only distinctive and common
characteristic of all the classes in each family, the base class.
Depending on the container class, you can use 'enable_if' to generate the right overload, or use the following
dispatch technique (used in the Boost.Optional class):
struct C
{
   C() : contained_(0) {}
   C ( X const& v ) : contained_ ( new X(v) ) {}
   template<class Expr&gt
   C ( Expr const& expr )
    :
    contained_ ( uninitialized_storage() )
   {
    construct(expr,&expr)
   }
  ~C() { delete contained_ ; }
  template<class InPlaceFactory>
  void construct ( InPlaceFactory const& aFactory, boost::in_place_factory_base* )
  {
    aFactory.template apply<X>(contained_);
  }
  template<class TypedInPlaceFactory>
  void construct ( TypedInPlaceFactory const& aFactory, boost::typed_in_place_factory_base* )
  {
    aFactory.apply(contained_);
  }
  X* uninitialized_storage() { return static_cast<X*>(new char[sizeof(X)]) ; }
  X* contained_ ;
} ;
User-side Usage
End users pass to the container an instance of a factory object holding the actual parameters needed to construct the
contained object directly within the container. For this, the helper template function 'in_place' is used.
The call 'in_place(a0,a1,a2,...,an)' constructs a (non-typed) 'in_place_factory' instance with the given argument list.
The call 'in_place<T>(a0,a1,a2,...,an)' constructs a 'typed_in_place_factory' instance with the given argument list for the
type 'T'.
void foo()
{
  C a( in_place(123,"hello") ) ;    // in_place_factory passed
  C b( in_place<X>(456,"world") ) ; // typed_in_place_factory passed
}
