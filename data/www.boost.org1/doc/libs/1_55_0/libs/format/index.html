  Boost Format library
  The format library provides a class for formatting arguments according
  to a format-string, as does printf, but with two major differences
  :
  
    format sends the arguments to an internal stream, and so is entirely
    type-safe and naturally supports all user-defined types.
    The ellipsis (...) can not be used correctly in the strongly typed
    context of format, and thus the function call with arbitrary arguments is
    replaced by successive calls to an argument feeding
    operator%

    Headers
      
        format.hpp : user
        frontend.
        format_fwd.hpp :
        user forward declarations.
        format_class.hpp : the
        class interface
        format_implementation.hpp:
        implementation of the member functions
        feed_args.hpp :
        argument feeding helper functions
        free_funcs.hpp :
        free functions definitions
        parsing.hpp : code
        for parsing format-strings
        group.hpp : auxiliary
        struct used to group arguments and manipulators
        exceptions.hpp :
        exceptions used by the library
        internals.hpp :
        auxiliary structs stream_format_state and format_item
      
    
    Sample programs
      
        The program sample_formats.cpp demonstrates
        simple uses of format.
        sample_new_features.cpp
        illustrates the few formatting features that were added to printf's
        syntax such as simple positional directives, centered alignment, and
        'tabulations'.
        sample_advanced.cpp
        demonstrates uses of advanced features, like reusing, and modifying,
        format objects, etc..
        And sample_userType.cpp shows the
        behaviour of the format library on user-defined types.
