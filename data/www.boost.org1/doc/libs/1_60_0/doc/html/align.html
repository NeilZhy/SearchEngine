Introduction
      This library provides an alignment function, aligned allocation and deallocation
      functions, an aligned allocator, an aligned allocator adaptor, an aligned deleter,
      a type trait to query alignment requirements, a macro to hint pointer alignment,
      and a function to verify pointer value alignment.
