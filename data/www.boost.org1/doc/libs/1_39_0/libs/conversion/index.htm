Boost
Conversion Library
The Conversion Library improves program safety and clarity by performing
otherwise messy conversions.  It includes cast-style function templates designed to complement the C++
Standard's built-in casts.
To reduce coupling, particularly to standard library IOStreams, the Boost
Conversion Library is
supplied by several headers:
  The boost/cast header provides polymorphic_cast<>
    and polymorphic_downcast<> to perform safe casting between
  polymorphic types.
  
  The boost/lexical_cast header provides lexical_cast<>
    general literal text conversions, such as an int represented as
    a string, or vice-versa.
