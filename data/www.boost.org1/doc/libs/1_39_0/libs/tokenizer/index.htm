  Acknowledgements
  I wish to thank the members of the boost mailing list, whose comments,
  compliments, and criticisms during both the development and formal review
  helped make the Tokenizer library what it is. I especially wish to thank
  Aleksey Gurtovoy for the idea of using a pair of iterators to specify the
  input, instead of a string. I also wish to thank Jeremy Siek for his idea
  of providing a container interface for the token iterators and for
  simplifying the template parameters for the TokenizerFunctions. He and
  Daryle Walker also emphasized the need to separate interface and
  implementation. Gary Powell sparked the idea of using the isspace and
  ispunct as the defaults for char_delimiters_separator. Jeff Garland
  provided ideas on how to change to order of the template parameters in
  order to make tokenizer easier to declare. Thanks to Douglas Gregor who
  served as review manager and provided many insights both on the boost list
  and in e-mail on how to polish up the implementation and presentation of
  Tokenizer. Finally, thanks to Beman Dawes who integrated the final version
  into the boost distribution.
