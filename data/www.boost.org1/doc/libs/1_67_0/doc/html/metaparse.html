Description
      Metaparse is a parser generator library for template metaprograms. The purpose
      of this library is to support the creation of parsers that parse at compile
      time. This library is intended to be used for embedded domain specific language
      creation for C++. The input of the generated parser is a compile time string,
      see string.
      The result of the parsing process is either an error or any other result the
      writer of the parser specifies.
    
      The library is similar to Boost.Spirit, however while parsers built with Spirit
      parse at run-time, parsers built with Metaparse parse at compile-time. Parsers
      built with Metaparse can output:
    
          types
        
          constant values
        
          objects (types with public static members)
        
          callable C++ functions (types with public static method)
        
          template metafunction classes
        
      See section What can be built from a compile-time
      string? for further details.
    
      Based on C++11 features the library can provide advanced utilities for defining
      the input string, the rest of the library works on C++98-based compilers as
      well. Note that if you build the tests and examples with Boost.Build using
      GCC or Clang, the compiler will not have C++11 (or newer) enabled. To build
      the tests and examples in C++11-mode, you need to run b2
      cxxflags="-std=c++11".
