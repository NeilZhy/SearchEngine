      Description
    
      Boost.Accumulators is both a library for incremental statistical computation
      as well as an extensible framework for incremental calculation in general.
      The library deals primarily with the concept of an accumulator,
      which is a primitive computational entity that accepts data one sample at a
      time and maintains some internal state. These accumulators may offload some
      of their computations on other accumulators, on which they depend. Accumulators
      are grouped within an accumulator set. Boost.Accumulators
      resolves the inter-dependencies between accumulators in a set and ensures that
      accumulators are processed in the proper order.
