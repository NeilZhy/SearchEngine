Introduction
        The String Algorithm Library provides a generic implementation of
        string-related algorithms which are missing in STL. It is an extension
        to the algorithms library of STL and it includes trimming, case conversion, 
        predicates and find/replace functions. All of them come in different variants 
        so it is easier to choose the best fit for a particular need.
    
        The implementation is not restricted to work with a particular container 
        (like std::basic_string), rather it is as generic as
        possible. This generalization is not compromising the performance since
        algorithms are using container specific features when it means a performance
        gain.
    
        
            Important note: In this documentation we use term string to 
            designate a sequence of characters stored in an arbitrary container.
            A string is not restricted to std::basic_string and 
            character does not have to be char or wchar_t,
            although these are most common candidates.
        
        Consult the design chapter to see precise specification of
        supported string types.
    
      
        The library interface functions and classes are defined in namespace boost::algorithm, and
        they are lifted into namespace boost via using declaration.
    
        The documentation is divided into several sections. For a quick start read the 
        Usage section followed by 
        Quick Reference. 
        The Design Topics,
        Concepts and Rationale
        provide some explanation about the library design and structure an explain how it should be used.
        See the Reference for the complete list of provided utilities
        and algorithms. Functions and classes in the reference are organized by the headers in which they are defined.
        The reference contains links to the detailed description for every entity in the library.
