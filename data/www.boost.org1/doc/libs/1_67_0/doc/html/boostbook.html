Introduction
The BoostBook documentation format is an extension of DocBook, an SGML- or
    XML-based format for describing documentation. BoostBook augments
    DocBook with semantic markup that aids in the documentation of C++
    libraries, specifically the Boost C++ libraries, by
    providing the ability to express and refer to C++ constructs such
    as namespaces, classes, overloaded functions, templates, and
    specializations.
    BoostBook offers additional features more specific to its use for
    documenting the Boost C++
    libraries. These features are intended to eliminate or
    reduce the need for duplication of information and to aid in
    documenting portions of Boost that might otherwise not be
    documented. Examples of Boost-centric features include:
      
Testsuites:
          Testsuites in Boost are created by writing an appropriate
          Jamfile and including that Jamfile in
          status/Jamfile. If the testsuites are
          documented (as
          in the MultiArray library), the documentation is
          maintained separately from the testcase Jamfile, leading to
          duplication of information and the possibility of having the
          documentation out of sync with the Jamfile. BoostBook
          contains elements that describe a testsuite for both
          purposes: the BoostBook stylesheets can generate
          documentation for the testcases and also generate an
          appropriate Jamfile to integrate the testcases with the
          regression testing system.
Example programs:
          Example programs in documentation need to be duplicated in
          testcases to ensure that the examples compile and execute
          correctly. Keeping the two copies in sync is a tedious and
          error-prone task. For instance, the following code snippet
          persisted for six months:
std::cout << f(5, 3) >> std::endl;
The BoostBook format allows testcases to be generated
          by weaving together program fragments from example programs
          in the documentation. This capability is integrated with
          testsuite generation so that example programs are normal
          tests in BoostBook.
