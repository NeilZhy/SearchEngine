FAQ
How
      does one distinguish between quantities that are physically different but have
      the same units (such as energy and torque)?
Angles are treated as
      units
Why are there
      homogeneous systems? Aren't heterogeneous systems sufficient?
Why can't
      I construct a quantity directly from the value type?
Why are conversions
      explicit by default?

Introduction
      The Boost.Units library is a C++ implementation of dimensional analysis in
      a general and extensible manner, treating it as a generic compile-time metaprogramming
      problem. With appropriate compiler optimization, no runtime execution cost
      is introduced, facilitating the use of this library to provide dimension checking
      in performance-critical code. Support for units and quantities (defined as
      a unit and associated value) for arbitrary unit system models and arbitrary
      value types is provided, as is a fine-grained general facility for unit conversions.
      Complete SI and CGS unit systems are provided, along with systems for angles
      measured in degrees, radians, gradians, and revolutions and systems for temperatures
      measured in Kelvin, degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit. The library architecture
      has been designed with flexibility and extensibility in mind; demonstrations
      of the ease of adding new units and unit conversions are provided in the examples.
    
      In order to enable complex compile-time dimensional analysis calculations with
      no runtime overhead, Boost.Units relies heavily on the Boost Metaprogramming Library
      (MPL) and on template metaprogramming techniques, and is, as a consequence,
      fairly demanding of compiler compliance to ISO standards. At present, it has
      been successfully compiled and tested on the following compilers/platforms
      :
    
          g++ 4.0.1 on Mac OSX 10.4
        
          Intel CC 9.1, 10.0, and 10.1 on Mac OSX 10.4
        
          g++ 3.4.4, 4.2.3, and 4.3.0 on Windows XP
        
          Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1, 8.0, and 9.0 on Windows XP
        
          Comeau 4.3.10.1 beta2 on Windows XP
        
          Metrowerks CodeWarrior 9.2 on Windows XP.
        
          Sun CC 5.9 on Solaris and Linux
        
      The following compilers/platforms are known not
      to work :
    
          g++ 3.3.x
        
          Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 on Windows XP
        
          Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0 on Windows XP
        
          Metrowerks CodeWarrior 8.0 on Windows XP.
        
          All versions of Borland.
