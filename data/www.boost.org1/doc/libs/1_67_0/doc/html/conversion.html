Description
      The Conversion Library improves program safety and clarity by performing otherwise
      messy conversions. It includes cast-style function templates designed to complement
      the C++ Standard's built-in casts.
    
      To reduce coupling, particularly to standard library IOStreams, the Boost Conversion
      Library is supplied by several headers:
    
          The boost/polymorphic_cast.hpp
          header provides polymorphic_cast<>
          and polymorphic_downcast<>
          to perform safe casting between polymorphic types.
        
          The boost/polymorphic_pointer_cast.hpp
          header provides polymorphic_pointer_cast<>
          and polymorphic_pointer_downcast<>
        
          The boost/implicit_cast.hpp
          header provides implicit_cast<> to perform implicit
          casts only (no down-cast, no void*->T*, no U->T if T has only explicit
          constructors for U).
        
          The boost/lexical_cast.hpp
          header provides lexical_cast<>
          general literal text conversions, such as an int represented
          as a string, or vice-versa.
