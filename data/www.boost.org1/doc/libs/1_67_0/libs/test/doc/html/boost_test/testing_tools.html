Summary of the API
      for writing tests
      Once a test case has been declared, the body of this test should be written.
      A test case is a sequence of operations in which assertions
      are inserted. Those assertions evaluate statements that
      implement the expectation being validated, and report failures and/or informations
      in a uniform manner, depending on the log
      level.
    
      The Unit Test Framework's supplies a toolbox of assertions
      to ease the creation and maintenance of test cases and provide a uniform error
      reporting mechanism. The toolbox supplied is in most part in a form of macro
      declarations. An (almost) unique interface to all of them implemented by the
      macro BOOST_TEST.
    
Note
        All macros arguments are calculated once, so it's safe to pass complex expressions
        in their place.
      
      All tools automatically supply an error location: a file name and a line number,
      which can also be overridden.
    
Caution
        The testing tools are intended for unit test code rather than library or
        production code, where throwing exceptions, using assert(), boost::concept_check
        or BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT()
        may be more suitable ways to detect and report errors.
      
      For a list of all supplied testing tools and usage examples, see the summary or the reference.
