Summary
      of the API for declaring and organizing tests
      If you look at many legacy test modules, big chance is that it's implemented
      as one big test function that consists of a mixture of check and output statements.
      Is there anything wrong with it? Yes. There are various disadvantages in single
      test function approach:
    
          One big function tends to become really difficult to manage if the number
          of checks exceeds a reasonable limit (true for any large function). What
          is tested and where - who knows?
        
          Many checks require similar preparations. This results in code repetitions
          within the test function.
        
          If a fatal error or an exception is caused by any checks within the test
          function the rest of tests are skipped and there is no way to prevent this.
        
          No way to perform only checks for a particular subsystem of the tested
          unit.
        
          No summary of how different subsystems of the tested unit performed under
          in the test.
        
      The above points should make it clear that it's preferable to split a test module into smaller units.
      These units are the test cases, the test suites and the fixtures.
    
Subjects covered by this section
Declaration
            The Unit Test Framework supports several methods
            for declaring a test
            case. Test cases can be implemented using free function like syntax
            or based on actual free function, function object, that can be defined
            with or without parameters/data, or as template functions to be run against
            various types.
          
Organization
            The Unit Test Framework provides facilities to group
            several test cases into test
            suites. The test suites can be nested, and the set of test suites
            and test cases defines the test tree, where the
            leaves are the test cases. Besides hierarchical structure the Unit
            Test Framework allows you to organize the test tree using
            logical grouping and dependencies
            and provides you with controls to utilize the defined test tree organization
            the way you want.
          
Attributes
            It is possible to specify test unit attributes by
            using decorators.
            Attributes are used for a fine grained control over various aspects of
            test module execution, such as logical grouping,
            dependencies, expected failures,
            etc.
          
Setup/teardown test unit actions
            When several tests shares the same set-up (environment, test data preparation,
            etc.), the preparation and cleanup code may be factorized in fixtures.
            In the Unit Test Framework, fixtures can be associated
            to test cases, test suites or globally to the test module.
