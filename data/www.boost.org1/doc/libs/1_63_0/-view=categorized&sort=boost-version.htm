              By Category
              
String and text processingRegex: Regular expression library.
Lexical Cast: General literal text conversions, such as an int represented a string, or vice-versa.
Tokenizer: Break of a string or other character sequence into a series of tokens.
Format: The format library provides a class for formatting arguments according to a format-string, as does printf, but with two major differences: format sends the arguments to an internal stream, and so is entirely type-safe and naturally supports all user-defined types; the ellipsis (...) can not be used correctly in the strongly typed context of format, and thus the function call with arbitrary arguments is replaced by successive calls to an argument feeding operator%.
Spirit: LL parser framework represents parsers directly as EBNF grammars in inlined C++.
String Algo: String algorithms library.
Iostreams: Boost.IOStreams provides a framework for defining streams, stream buffers and i/o filters.
Wave: The Boost.Wave library is a Standards conformant, and highly configurable implementation of the mandated C99/C++ preprocessor functionality packed behind an easy to use iterator interface.
Xpressive: Regular expressions that can be written as strings or as expression templates, and which can refer to each other and themselves recursively with the power of context-free grammars.
Locale: Provide localization and Unicode handling tools for C++.
Convert: An extendible and configurable type-conversion framework.
ContainersArray: STL compliant container wrapper for arrays of constant size.
Graph: The BGL graph interface and graph components are generic, in the same sense as the the Standard Template Library (STL).
Property Map: Concepts defining interfaces which map key objects to value objects.
Multi-Array: Boost.MultiArray provides a generic N-dimensional array concept definition and common implementations of that interface.
Dynamic Bitset: The dynamic_bitset class represents a set of bits. It provides accesses to the value of individual bits via an operator[] and provides all of the bitwise operators that one can apply to builtin integers, such as operator& and operator<<. The number of bits in the set is specified at runtime via a parameter to the constructor of the dynamic_bitset.
Variant: Safe, generic, stack-based discriminated union container.
Multi-Index: The Boost Multi-index Containers Library provides a class template named multi_index_container which enables the construction of containers maintaining one or more indices with different sorting and access semantics.
Pointer Container: Containers for storing heap-allocated polymorphic objects to ease OO-programming.
Intrusive: Intrusive containers and algorithms.
Circular Buffer: A STL compliant container also known as ring or cyclic buffer.
GIL: Generic Image Library
Bimap: Bidirectional maps library for C++. With Boost.Bimap you can create associative containers in which both types can be used as key.
Unordered: Unordered associative containers.
GraphParallel: The PBGL graph interface and graph components are generic, in the same sense as the the Standard Template Library (STL).

Container: Standard library containers and extensions.
IteratorsOperators: Templates ease arithmetic classes and iterators.

GIL: Generic Image Library

Range: A new infrastructure for generic algorithms that builds on top of the new iterator concepts.
Foreach: In C++, writing a loop that iterates over a sequence is tedious. We can either use iterators, which requires a considerable amount of boiler-plate, or we can use the std::for_each() algorithm and move our loop body into a predicate, which requires no less boiler-plate and forces us to move our logic far from where it will be used. In contrast, some other languages, like Perl, provide a dedicated "foreach" construct that automates this process. BOOST_FOREACH is just such a construct for C++. It iterates over sequences for us, freeing us from having to deal directly with iterators or write predicates.
