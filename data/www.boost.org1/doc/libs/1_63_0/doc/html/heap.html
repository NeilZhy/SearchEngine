Introduction & Motivation
      boost.heap is an implementation of priority queues. Priority
      queues are queue data structures, that order their elements by a priority.
      The STL provides a single template class std::priority_queue,
      which only provides a limited functionality. To overcome these limitations,
      boost.heap implements data
      structures with more functionality and different performance characteristics.
      Especially, it deals with additional aspects:
    
          Mutability: The priority of heap elements
          can be modified.
        
          Iterators: Heaps provide iterators to
          iterate all elements.
        
          Mergable: While all heaps can be merged,
          some can be merged efficiently.
        
          Stability: Heaps can be configured to
          be stable sorted.
        
          Comparison: Heaps can be compared for
          equivalence.
