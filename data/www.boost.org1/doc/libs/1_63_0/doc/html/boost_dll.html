Motivation
      Adding a specific features to an existing software applications at runtime
      could be useful in many cases. Such extensions, or plugins, are usually implemented
      using Dynamic Library Modules (DLL,SO/DSO) loaded at runtime.
    
      This library was designed to simplify plugin development using C++ in a portable
      cross-platform manner.
    
      Library provides a portable across platforms way to:
    
          load libraries
        
          import any native functions and variables
        
          make alias names for C++ mangled functions and symbols
        
          query libraries for sections and exported symbols
        
          self loading and self querying
        
          getting program and module location by exported symbol
