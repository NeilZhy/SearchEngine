  Policies
  The interval template requires two arguments. The first
  corresponds to the base type chosen for the bounds. And the second defines
  the rounding and checking behaviors of the newly constructed class. This
  second argument is not mandatory but may need some customizations. In order
  to ease the manipulations, some helper templates are provided in
  interval/policies.hpp.
  
namespace boost {
namespace numeric {
namespace interval_lib {
template<class Rounding, class Checking>
struct policies {
  typedef Rounding rounding;
  typedef Checking checking;
};
template<class OldInterval, class NewRounding>
struct change_rounding {
  typedef ... type;
};
template<class OldInterval, class NewChecking>
struct change_checking {
  typedef ... type;
};
template<class OldInterval>
struct unprotect {
  typedef ... type;
};
} // namespace interval_lib
} // namespace numeric
} // namespace boost
  The policies template should be used whenever the user
  needs to define a policy structure for an interval class.
  change_rounding and change_checking can be used
  to get the type of a new interval by changing one of the policies of an old
  interval; the new type is available thanks to the type definition
  type. Finally, unprotect looks like
  change_rounding and directly changes the rounding of an
  interval to its unprotected version (a better explanation is available
  here).
