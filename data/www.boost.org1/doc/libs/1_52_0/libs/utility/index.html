		Boost 
			Utility Library
		The Boost Utility Library isn't really a single library at all. It is just a 
			collection for components too small to be called libraries in their own right.
		But that doesn't mean there isn't useful stuff here. Take a look:
		
			
				assert
				base_from_member
				call_traits
				checked_delete
				compressed_pair
				current_function
				declval
				enable_if
            iterator_adaptors
            generator iterator adaptors
				operators
				swap
				throw_exception
				utility
                value_init
