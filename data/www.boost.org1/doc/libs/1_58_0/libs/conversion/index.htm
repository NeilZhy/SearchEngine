Boost
Conversion Library
The Conversion Library improves program safety and clarity by performing
otherwise messy conversions.  It includes cast-style function templates designed to complement the C++
Standard's built-in casts.
To reduce coupling, particularly to standard library IOStreams, the Boost
Conversion Library is
supplied by several headers:
  The boost/polymorphic_cast.hpp and boost/polymorphic_pointer_cast.hpp 
    headers provide polymorphic_cast<>,
    polymorphic_downcast<> and polymorphic_pointer_downcast<> to perform safe casting between
  polymorphic types.
  
  The boost/implicit_cast.hpp header provides implicit_cast<>
    to perform implicit casts only (no down-cast, no void*->T*, no U->T if T has only explicit constructors for U).
  
  The boost/lexical_cast header provides lexical_cast<>
    general literal text conversions, such as an int represented as
    a string, or vice-versa.
