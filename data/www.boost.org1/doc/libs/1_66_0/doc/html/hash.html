Introduction
      boost::hash is an implementation of
      the hash function
      object specified by the Draft
      Technical Report on C++ Library Extensions (TR1). It is the default
      hash function for Boost.Unordered, Boost.Intrusive's
      unordered associative containers, and Boost.MultiIndex's
      hash indicies and Boost.Bimap's
      unordered_set_of.
    
      As it is compliant with TR1,
      it will work with:
    
          integers
        
          floats
        
          pointers
        
          strings
        
      It also implements the extension proposed by Peter Dimov in issue 6.18 of the
      Library
      Extension Technical Report Issues List (page 63), this adds support
      for:
    
          arrays
        
          std::pair
        
          the standard containers.
        
          extending boost::hash for custom
          types.
        
Note
        This hash function is designed to be used in containers based on the STL
        and is not suitable as a general purpose hash function. For more details
        see the rationale.
