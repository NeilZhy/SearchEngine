Introduction
The Boost.Function library contains a family of class templates
that are function object wrappers. The notion is similar to a
generalized callback. It shares features with function pointers in
that both define a call interface (e.g., a function taking two integer
arguments and returning a floating-point value) through which some
implementation can be called, and the implementation that is invoked
may change throughout the course of the program.
 Generally, any place in which a function pointer would be used
to defer a call or make a callback, Boost.Function can be used instead
to allow the user greater flexibility in the implementation of the
target. Targets can be any 'compatible' function object (or function
pointer), meaning that the arguments to the interface designated by
Boost.Function can be converted to the arguments of the target
function object.
