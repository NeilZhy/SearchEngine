Networking TS compatibility
      Boost.Asio now provides the interfaces and functionality specified by the "C++
      Extensions for Networking" Technical Specification. In addition to access
      via the usual Boost.Asio header files, this functionality may be accessed through
      special headers that correspond to the header files defined in the TS. These
      are listed in the table below:

      In some cases the new Networking TS compatible interfaces supersede older Boost.Asio
      facilities. In these cases the older interfaces have been deprecated. The table
      below shows the new Networking TS interfaces and the facilities they replace:
