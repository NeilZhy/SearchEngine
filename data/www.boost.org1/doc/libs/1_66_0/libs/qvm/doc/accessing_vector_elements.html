    namespace qvm
    {
        //Only enabled if:
        //  is_vec<V>::value
        
        template <int I,class V> -unspecified-return-type- A( V & v );
        template <class V> -unspecified-return-type- A0( V & v );
        template <class V> -unspecified-return-type- A1( V & v );
        ...
        template <class V> -unspecified-return-type- A9( V & v );
        
        template <class V> -unspecified-return-type- X( V & v );
        template <class V> -unspecified-return-type- Y( V & v );
        template <class V> -unspecified-return-type- Z( V & v );
        template <class V> -unspecified-return-type- W( V & v );
    }
}
An expression of the form of A<I>(v) can be used to access the I-th element a vector object v. For example, the expression:
A<1>(v) *= 42;
can be used to multiply the element at index 1 (indexing in Boost QVM is always zero-based) of a vector v by 42.
For convenience, there are also non-template overloads for I from 0 to 9; an alternative way to write the above expression is:
A1(v) *= 42;
X, Y, Z and W act the same as A0/A1/A2/A3; yet another alternative way to write the above expression is:
Y(v) *= 42;
