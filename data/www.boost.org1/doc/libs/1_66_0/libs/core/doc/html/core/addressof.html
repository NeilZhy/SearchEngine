Header
      <boost/core/addressof.hpp>
        The header <boost/core/addressof.hpp>
        defines the function template boost::addressof.
        boost::addressof(x) returns
        the address of x. Ordinarily,
        this address can be obtained by &x, but the unary &
        operator can be overloaded. boost::addressof
        avoids calling used-defined operator&().
      
        boost::addressof was originally contributed by
        Brad King based on ideas from discussion with Doug Gregor.
      
Synopsis
namespace boost
{
    template<class T> T* addressof( T& x );
}
Example
#include <boost/core/addressof.hpp>
struct useless_type { };
class nonaddressable {
    useless_type operator&() const;
};
void f() {
    nonaddressable x;
    nonaddressable* xp = boost::addressof(x);
    // nonaddressable* xpe =  /* error */
}
Notes
          In C++11 and above, boost::addressof
          is conditionally constexpr
          when possible. This is indicated by BOOST_CORE_NO_CONSTEXPR_ADDRESSOF
          not being defined.
        
          With supported compilers, boost::addressof
          is always constexpr by leveraging
          compiler intrinsics. This is indicated by BOOST_CORE_HAS_BUILTIN_ADDRESSOF
          being defined.
