Boost Exception
enable_current_exception
include <boost/exception/enable_current_exception.hpp>
namespace
boost
    {
    template <class T>
    ---unspecified--- enable_current_exception( T const & e );
    }
Requirements:
 T must be a class with an accessible no-throw copy constructor.
 If T has any virtual base types, those types must have an accessible default constructor.
Returns:
An object of unspecified type which derives publicly from T. That is, the returned object can be intercepted by a catch(T &).
Description:
This function is designed to be used directly in a throw-expression to enable the exception_ptr support in Boost Exception. For example:
class
my_exception:
    public std::exception
    {
    };
....
throw boost::enable_current_exception(my_exception());
Unless enable_current_exception is called at the time an exception object is used in a throw-expression, an attempt to copy it using current_exception may return an exception_ptr which refers to an instance of unknown_exception. See current_exception for details.
Note:
Instead of using the throw keyword directly, it is preferable to call boost::throw_exception. This is guaranteed to throw an exception that derives from boost::exception and supports the exception_ptr functionality.
