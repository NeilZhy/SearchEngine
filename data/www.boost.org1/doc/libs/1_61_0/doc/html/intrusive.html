Introduction

      Boost.Intrusive
Building
      Boost.Intrusive
Presenting
      Boost.Intrusive
        Boost.Intrusive is a library presenting
        some intrusive containers to the world of C++. Intrusive containers are special
        containers that offer better performance
        and exception safety guarantees than non-intrusive containers (like STL containers).
      
        The performance benefits of intrusive containers makes them ideal as a building
        block to efficiently construct complex containers like multi-index containers
        or to design high performance code like memory allocation algorithms.
      
        While intrusive containers were and are widely used in C, they became more
        and more forgotten in C++ due to the presence of the standard containers
        which don't support intrusive techniques.Boost.Intrusive
        wants to push intrusive containers usage encapsulating the implementation
        in STL-like interfaces. Hence anyone familiar with standard containers can
        easily use Boost.Intrusive.
      
Building
      Boost.Intrusive
        There is no need to compile anything to use Boost.Intrusive,
        since it's a header only library. Just include your Boost header directory
        in your compiler include path.
