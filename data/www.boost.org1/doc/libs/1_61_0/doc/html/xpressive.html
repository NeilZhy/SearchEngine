      Description
    
      xpressive is an advanced, object-oriented regular expression template library
      for C++. Regular expressions can be written as strings that are parsed at run-time,
      or as expression templates that are parsed at compile-time. Regular expressions
      can refer to each other and to themselves recursively, allowing you to build
      arbitrarily complicated grammars out of them.
    
      Motivation
    
      If you need to manipulate text in C++, you have typically had two disjoint
      options: a regular expression engine or a parser generator. Regular expression
      engines (like Boost.Regex) are powerful
      and flexible; patterns are represented as strings which can be specified at
      runtime. However, that means that syntax errors are likewise not detected until
      runtime. Also, regular expressions are ill-suited to advanced text processing
      tasks such as matching balanced, nested tags. Those tasks have traditionally
      been handled by parser generators (like the Spirit
      Parser Framework). These beasts are more powerful but less flexible.
      They generally don't allow you to arbitrarily modify your grammar rules on
      the fly. In addition, they don't have the exhaustive backtracking semantics
      of regular expressions, which can make it more challenging to author some types
      of patterns.
    
      xpressive brings these two approaches seamlessly together and occupies a unique
      niche in the world of C++ text processing. With xpressive, you can choose to
      use it much as you would use Boost.Regex,
      representing regular expressions as strings. Or you can use it as you would
      use Spirit, writing your
      regexes as C++ expressions, enjoying all the benefits of an embedded language
      dedicated to text manipulation. What's more, you can mix the two to get the
      benefits of both, writing regular expression grammars
      in which some of the regular expressions are statically bound -- hard-coded
      and syntax-checked by the compiler -- and others are dynamically bound and
      specified at runtime. These regular expressions can refer to each other recursively,
      matching patterns in strings that ordinary regular expressions cannot.
    
      Influences
      and Related Work
    
      The design of xpressive's interface has been strongly influenced by John Maddock's
      Boost.Regex library and his proposal
      to add regular expressions to the Standard Library. I also drew a great deal
      of inspiration from Joel de Guzman's Spirit
      Parser Framework, which served as the model for static xpressive. Other
      sources of inspiration are the Perl
      6 redesign and GRETA.
      (You can read a summary of the changes Perl 6 will bring to regex culture
      here.)
