What is Property Tree?
      The Property Tree library provides a data structure that stores an arbitrarily
      deeply nested tree of values, indexed at each level by some key. Each node
      of the tree stores its own value, plus an ordered list of its subnodes and
      their keys. The tree allows easy access to any of its nodes by means of a path,
      which is a concatenation of multiple keys.
    
      In addition, the library provides parsers and generators for a number of data
      formats that can be represented by such a tree, including XML, INI, and JSON.
    
      Property trees are versatile data structures, but are particularly suited for
      holding configuration data. The tree provides its own, tree-specific interface,
      and each node is also an STL-compatible Sequence for its child nodes.
    
      Conceptually, then, a node can be thought of as the following structure:
    
struct ptree
{
   data_type data;                         // data associated with the node
   list< pair<key_type, ptree> > children; // ordered list of named children
};
      Both key_type and data_type are configurable to some extent, but will usually
      be std::string or std::wstring, and the parsers only work with this kind of
      tree.
    
      Many software projects develop a similar tool at some point of their lifetime,
      and property tree originated the same way. We hope the library can save many
      from reinventing the wheel.
