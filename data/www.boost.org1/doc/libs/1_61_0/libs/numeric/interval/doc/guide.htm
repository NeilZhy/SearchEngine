  Choosing Your Own Interval Type
  First of all, you need to select your base type. In order to obtain an
  useful interval type, the numbers should respect some requirements. Please
  refer to this page in order to see them. When
  your base type is robust enough, you can go to the next step: the choice of
  the policies.
  As you should already know if you did not come to this page by accident,
  the interval class expect a policies argument describing the
  rounding and checking
  policies. The first thing to do is to verify if the default policies are or
  are not adapted to your case. If your base type is not float,
  double, or long double, the default rounding
  policy is probably not adapted. However, by specializing
  interval_lib::rounded_math to your base type, the default
  rounding policy will be suitable.
  The default policies define an interval type that performs precise
  computations (for float, double, long
  double), detects invalid numbers and throws exception each times an
  empty interval is created. This is a brief description and you should refer
  to the corresponding sections for a more precise description of the default
  policies. Unless you need some special behavior, this default type is
  usable in a lot of situations.
  After having completely defined the interval type (and its policies),
  the only thing left to do is to verify that the constants are defined and
  std::numeric_limits is correct (if needed). Now you can use
  your brand new interval type.
  Some Examples
  Solving systems
  If you use the interval library in order to solve equation and
  inequation systems by bisection, something like
  boost::interval<double> is probably what you need. The
  computations are precise, and they may be fast if enclosed in a protected
  rounding mode block (see the performance
  section). The comparison are "certain"; it is probably the most used type
  of comparison, and the other comparisons are still accessible by the
  explicit comparison functions. The checking forbid empty interval; they are
  not needed since there would be an empty interval at end of the computation
  if an empty interval is created during the computation, and no root would
  be inside. The checking also forbid invalid numbers (NaN for floating-point
  numbers). It can be a minor performance hit if you only use exact
  floating-point constants (which are clearly not NaNs); however, if
  performance really does matter, you will probably use a good compiler which
  knows how to inline functions and all these annoying little tests will
  magically disappear (if not, it is time to upgrade your compiler).
  Manipulating wide intervals
  You may want to use the library on intervals with imprecise bounds or on
  inexact numbers. In particular, it may be an existing algorithm that you
  want to rewrite and simplify by using the library. In that case, you are
  not really interested by the inclusion property; you are only interested by
  the computation algorithms the library provides. So you do not need to use
  any rounding; the checking also may not be useful. Use an "exact
  computation" rounding (you are allowed to think the name strangely applies
  to the situation) and a checking that never tests for any invalid numbers
  or empty intervals. By doing that, you will obtain library functions
  reduced to their minimum (an addition of two intervals will only be two
  additions of numbers).
  Computing ranges
  The inputs of your program may be empty intervals or invalid values (for
  example, a database can allow undefined values in some field) and the core
  of your program could also do some non-arithmetic computations that do not
  always propagate empty intervals. For example, in the library, the
  hull function can happily receive an empty interval but not
  generate an empty interval if the other input is valid. The
  intersect function is also able to produce empty intervals if
  the intervals do not overlap. In that case, it is not really interesting if
  an exception is thrown each time an empty interval is produced or an
  invalid value is used; it would be better to generate and propagate empty
  intervals. So you need to change the checking policy to something like
  interval_lib::checking_base<T>.
  Switching interval types
  This example does not deal with a full case, but with a situation that
  can occur often. Sometimes, it can be useful to change the policies of an
  interval by converting it to another type. For example, this happens when
  you use an unprotected version of the interval type in order to speed up
  the computations; it is a change of the rounding policy. It also happens
  when you want to temporarily allow empty intervals to be created; it is a
  change of the checking policy. These changes should not be prohibited: they
  can greatly enhance a program (lisibility, interest, performance).
