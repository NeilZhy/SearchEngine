Overview
        The header <boost/checked_delete.hpp>
        defines two function templates, checked_delete
        and checked_array_delete,
        and two class templates, checked_deleter
        and checked_array_deleter.
      
        The C++ Standard allows, in 5.3.5/5, pointers to incomplete class types to
        be deleted with a delete-expression. When the class has a non-trivial destructor,
        or a class-specific operator delete, the behavior is undefined. Some compilers
        issue a warning when an incomplete type is deleted, but unfortunately, not
        all do, and programmers sometimes ignore or disable warnings.
      
        A particularly troublesome case is when a smart pointer's destructor, such
        as boost::scoped_ptr<T>::~scoped_ptr, is instantiated with an incomplete
        type. This can often lead to silent, hard to track failures.
      
        The supplied function and class templates can be used to prevent these problems,
        as they require a complete type, and cause a compilation error otherwise.

checked_delete
template<class
        T> void checked_delete(T * p);
              Requires: T
              must be a complete type. The expression delete
              p must be well-formed.
            
              Effects: delete
              p;
            
checked_array_delete
template<class
        T> void checked_array_delete(T * p);
              Requires: T
              must be a complete type. The expression delete
              [] p
              must be well-formed.
            
              Effects: delete

        checked_deleter<T>::operator()(T * p) const;
              Requires: T
              must be a complete type. The expression delete
              p must be well-formed.

Acknowledgements
        The function templates checked_delete
        and checked_array_delete
        were originally part of <boost/utility.hpp>,
        and the documentation acknowledged Beman Dawes, Dave Abrahams, Vladimir Prus,
        Rainer Deyke, John Maddock, and others as contributors.
