Introduction
      Boost.MPI is a library for message passing in high-performance parallel applications.
      A Boost.MPI program is one or more processes that can communicate either via
      sending and receiving individual messages (point-to-point communication) or
      by coordinating as a group (collective communication). Unlike communication
      in threaded environments or using a shared-memory library, Boost.MPI processes
      can be spread across many different machines, possibly with different operating
      systems and underlying architectures.
    
      Boost.MPI is not a completely new parallel programming library. Rather, it
      is a C++-friendly interface to the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI), the most popular library
      interface for high-performance, distributed computing. MPI defines a library
      interface, available from C, Fortran, and C++, for which there are many MPI implementations.
      Although there exist C++ bindings for MPI, they offer little functionality
      over the C bindings. The Boost.MPI library provides an alternative C++ interface
      to MPI that better supports modern C++ development styles, including complete
      support for user-defined data types and C++ Standard Library types, arbitrary
      function objects for collective algorithms, and the use of modern C++ library
      techniques to maintain maximal efficiency.
    
      At present, Boost.MPI supports the majority of functionality in MPI 1.1. The
      thin abstractions in Boost.MPI allow one to easily combine it with calls to
      the underlying C MPI library. Boost.MPI currently supports:
    
          Communicators: Boost.MPI supports the creation, destruction, cloning, and
          splitting of MPI communicators, along with manipulation of process groups.
        
          Point-to-point communication: Boost.MPI supports point-to-point communication
          of primitive and user-defined data types with send and receive operations,
          with blocking and non-blocking interfaces.
        
          Collective communication: Boost.MPI supports collective operations such
          as reduce
          and gather
          with both built-in and user-defined data types and function objects.
        
          MPI Datatypes: Boost.MPI can build MPI data types for user-defined types
          using the Boost.Serialization
          library.
        
          Separating structure from content: Boost.MPI can transfer the shape (or
          "skeleton") of complex data structures (lists, maps, etc.) and
          then separately transfer their content. This facility optimizes for cases
          where the data within a large, static data structure needs to be transmitted
          many times.
        
      Boost.MPI can be accessed either through its native C++ bindings, or through
      its alternative, Python interface.
