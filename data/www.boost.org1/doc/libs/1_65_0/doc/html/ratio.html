      How
      to Use This Documentation
    
      This documentation makes use of the following naming and formatting conventions.
    
          Code is in fixed width
          font and is syntax-highlighted.
        
          Replaceable text that you will need to supply is in italics.
        
          Free functions are rendered in the code font followed by (), as in free_function().
        
          If a name refers to a class template, it is specified like this: class_template<>;
          that is, it is in code font and its name is followed by <>
          to indicate that it is a class template.
        
          If a name refers to a function-like macro, it is specified like this:
          MACRO();
          that is, it is uppercase in code font and its name is followed by () to indicate that it is a function-like
          macro. Object-like macros appear without the trailing ().
        
          Names that refer to concepts in the generic programming
          sense are specified in CamelCase.
        
Note
        In addition, notes such as this one specify non-essential information that
        provides additional background or rationale.
      
      Finally, you can mentally add the following to any code fragments in this document:
    
// Include all of Ratio files
#include <boost/ratio.hpp>
using namespace boost;
Motivation
        Boost.Ratio aims to implement the compile
        time ratio facility in C++0x, as proposed in N2661 - A Foundation to Sleep On. That document
        provides background and motivation for key design decisions and is the source
        of a good deal of information in this documentation.
      
Description
        The Boost.Ratio library provides:
      
            A class template, ratio, for specifying compile
            time rational constants such as 1/3 of a nanosecond or the number of
            inches per meter. ratio represents a compile time
            ratio of compile time constants with support for compile time arithmetic
            with overflow and division by zero protection.
          
            It provides a textual representation of boost::ratio<N, D> in the form of a std::basic_string
            which can be useful for I/O.
          
            Some extension related to the Rational
            Constant concept enabling the use of ratio<> in the context
            of Boost.MPL numeric metafunctions.
