Introduction
      Boost.Process is a library to manage system processes. It can be used to:
    
          create child processes
        
          setup streams for child processes
        
          communicate with child processes through streams (synchronously or asynchronously)
        
          wait for processes to exit (synchronously or asynchronously)
        
          terminate processes
        
      Here's a simple example of how to start a program with Boost.Process:
    
#include <boost/process.hpp>
using namespace boost::process;
int main()
{
    ipstream pipe_stream;
    child c("gcc --version", std_out > pipe_stream);
    std::string line;
    while (pipe_stream && std::getline(pipe_stream, line) && !line.empty())
        std::cerr << line << std::endl;
    c.wait();
}
