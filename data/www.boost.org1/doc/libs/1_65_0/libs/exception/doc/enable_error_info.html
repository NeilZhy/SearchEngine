enable_error_info
include <boost/exception/enable_error_info.hpp>
namespace
boost
    {
    template <class T>
    ---unspecified--- enable_error_info( T const & x );
    }
Requirements:
T must be a class with an accessible no-throw copy constructor as per (15.5.1).
Returns:
 If T derives from boost::exception, the returned object is of type T and is a copy of x.
 Otherwise, the returned object is of an unspecified type that derives publicly from both T and boost::exception. The T sub-object is initialized from x by the T copy constructor.
Throws:
Nothing.
