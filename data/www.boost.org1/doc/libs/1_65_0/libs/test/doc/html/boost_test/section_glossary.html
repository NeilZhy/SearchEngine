Glossary
      Here is the list of terms used throughout this documentation.
    
      Test
      module
    
      This is a single binary that performs the test. Physically a test module consists
      of one or more test source files, which can be built into an executable or
      a dynamic library. A test module that consists of a single test source file
      is called single-file test module. Otherwise it's called
      multi-file test module. Logically, each test module consists
      of four parts:
    
          test setup (or test initialization),
        
          test body
        
          test cleanup
        
          test runner
        
      The test runner part is optional. If a test module is built as an executable,
      the test runner is built-in. If a test module is built as a dynamic library,
      it is run by an external
      test runner.
    
      Test
      body
    
      This is the part of a test module that actually performs the test. Logically
      test body is a collection of test assertions
      wrapped in test cases, which are organized
      in a test tree.
    
      Test
      tree
    
      This is a hierarchical structure of test suites
      (non-leaf nodes) and test cases (leaf nodes).
      More details can be found here.
    
      Test
      unit
    
      This is a collective name when referred to either a test
      suite or test cases. See this
      section for more details.
    
      Test
      assertion
    
      This is a single binary condition (binary in a sense that is has two outcomes:
      pass and fail) checked by a test module.
    
      There are different schools of thought on how many test assertions a test case
      should consist of. Two polar positions are the one advocated by TDD followers
      - one assertion per test case; and opposite of this - all test assertions within
      single test case - advocated by those only interested in the first error in
      a test module. The Unit Test Framework supports both approaches.
    
      Test
      case
    
      This is an independently monitored function within a test module that consists
      of one or more test assertions. The term independently monitored
      in the definition above is used to emphasize the fact, that all test cases
      are monitored independently. An uncaught exception or other normal test case
      execution termination doesn't cause the testing to cease. Instead the error
      is caught by the test case execution monitor, reported by the Unit
      Test Framework and testing proceeds to the next test case. Later
      on you are going to see that this is on of the primary reasons to prefer multiple
      small test cases to a single big test function.
    
      Test
      suite
    
      This is a container for one or more test cases. The test suite gives you an
      ability to group test cases into a single referable entity. There are various
      reasons why you may opt to do so, including:
    
          To group test cases per subsystems of the unit being tested.
        
          To share test case setup/cleanup code.
        
          To run selected group of test cases only.
        
          To see test report split by groups of test cases.
        
          To skip groups of test cases based on the result of another test unit in
          a test tree.
        
      A test suite can also contain other test suites, thus allowing a hierarchical
      test tree structure to be formed. The Unit Test Framework
      requires the test tree to contain at least one test suite with at least one
      test case. The top level test suite - root node of the test tree - is called
      the master test suite.
    
      Test
      setup
    
      This is the part of a test module that is responsible for the test preparation.
      It includes the following operations that take place prior to a start of the
      test:
    
          The Unit Test Framework initialization
        
          Test tree construction
        
          Global test module setup code
        
          Per test case setup code, invoked for every test case
          it's assigned to, is also attributed to the test initialization, even though
          it's executed as a part of the test case.
        
      Test
      cleanup
    
      This is the part of test module that is responsible for cleanup operations.
    
      Test
      fixture
    
      Matching setup and cleanup operations are frequently united into a single entity
      called test fixture.
    
      Test
      runner
    
      This is an orchestrator or a driver
      that, given the test tree, ensures the test tree is initialized, tests are
      executed and necessary reports generated. For more information see
      here.
    
      Test
      log
    
      This is the record of all events that occur during the testing.
    
      Test
      report
    
      This is the report produced by the Unit Test Framework
      after the testing is completed, that indicates which test cases/test suites
      passed and which failed.
