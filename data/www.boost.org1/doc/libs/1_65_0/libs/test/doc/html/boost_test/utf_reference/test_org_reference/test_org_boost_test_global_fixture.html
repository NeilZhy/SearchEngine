BOOST_TEST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE
          Declares and registers a global fixture. The global fixture acts exactly
          as a suite fixture attached to the master
          test suite, and is called before any of the test case in the test
          tree is executed.
        
          The class implementing the fixture should have the appropriate interface.
          As any fixture, it is possible to have test assertions in the global fixture.
