BOOST_TEST_GLOBAL_CONFIGURATION
          Declares a class that will be constructed during the initialization of
          the test framework, and destructed afterwards. The framework will not call
          any other member function than the constructor and destructor. In particular
          the constructor and destructor will be called prior and after to the global fixtures
          setup and teardown.
        
          This facility is provided to perform additional configuration, in particular
          programmatic configuration of the loggers and reporters. See this
          section for more details.
        
Warning
            No logging or any other call to the framework assertion is allowed in
            the constructor and destructor, as its purpose is to set-up the loggers/reporters,
            and the assertions are calling the logging/reporting facility. Any such
            assertion during the execution of the will result in the abortion of
            the test module .
