      Boost.Test
      v3.6 / boost 1.65
    
      Breaking
      changes
    
          BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE is flagged
          as deprecated and will be removed in a later version
        
          Using test assertions and macros is not allowed when used inside BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE. Please use
          BOOST_TEST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE instead
          (see below).
        
          the interface for loggers has slightly changed to take into account the
          current log level. This is for addressing #12631.

          VS2017 / C++17 compatibility (thanks to Daniela Engert)
        
          Deprecating BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE in favor
          of BOOST_TEST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE and
          BOOST_TEST_GLOBAL_CONFIGURATION.
          This helps separating the logic of the fixtures associated to the master
          test suite, from the one used for setting up the logging and reporting
          facility, and results in a general cleaner design.
        
          It is possible to use now the BOOST_TEST check to comparing
          a collection with respect to regular arrays. See this
          section for more details.

      New
      features
    
          Now Boost.Test provides customization
          points for logging user defined types: this solution is less intrusive
          than forcing the definition of operator<< for a specific type.
        
          JUnit
          output format can now have a log-level
          set between success and
          non-fatal error,
          and defaults to general information.
        
          JUnit
          output format is now more performant in case a lot of checks are
          done in a test module.

      Boost.Test
      v3.4 / boost 1.63
    
      Breaking
      changes
    
          Now colons that appear in test case names are replaced with underscores.
          This affect mainly the template/typed
          test cases. The change is needed since the colon ':' is interpreted as a filter separators
          since 1.62, and it is otherwise not possible to execute the tests reported
          by --list_content.
          See #12531 for more details.
        
      New

          Now per_element
          and lexicographic
          modifiers of BOOST_TEST can also be applied
          to string comparison. See string
          comparison for more details.

      Boost.Test
      v3.3 / boost 1.62
    
      New
      features
    
          Boost.Test now treats each sample of a dataset test case as being a uniquely
          named test case under the same test suite, which enables the (re)run of
          one particular sample from the command line interface. See here
          for more details,
        
          Boost.Test learned to interpret ':' as a separator for the test filters:
          the string passed to --run_test
          generates tokens as if --run_test has been repeated, which enables
          the set up of several test filters through the associated environment variable
          BOOST_TEST_RUN_FILTERS
        
          the Unit Test Framework learned to log the messages
          in the xUnit/JUNIT log format. See here
          for more details.
        
          the Unit Test Framework learned to have several loggers
          at the same time, each of which with their own log level and log sink.
          See the associated command line switch --logger
          and corresponding environment variable BOOST_TEST_LOGGER
          for more details.
        
          loggers are now able to indicate their default output stream and log level.

                it is now possible to use initializer lists

                now proposes closest matching command in case of ambiguity
              
                reports invalid or ambiguous parameters: this might break existing
                calls when user defined commands are provided to the test module.
                The following calling convention should be adopted:
                
                      if the test module uses user supplied commands, those should
                      be passed after an empty token --
                    
                      all boost.test related commands should be passed before --, if any
                    
              
                Example: the call
              
test_module --user-arg1=xy --log_level=test_suite
                should be rewritten to
              
test_module --log_level=test_suite -- --user-arg1=xy
