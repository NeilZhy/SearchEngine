BOOST_TEST_DISABLE_ALT_STACK
          Disables the support of the alternative stack.
        
          Define this macro before the inclusion of any Unit Test Framework
          header to disable the support of the alternative
          stack, in case your compiler does not support it and the Unit
          Test Framework cannot automatically guess the lack of support.
        
          See use_alt_stack and BOOST_TEST_DISABLE_ALT_STACK
          for more details.
