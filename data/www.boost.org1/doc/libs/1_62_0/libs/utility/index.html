		Boost 
			Utility Library
		The Boost Utility Library isn't really a single library at all. It is just a 
			collection for components too small to be called libraries in their own right.
		But that doesn't mean there isn't useful stuff here. Take a look:
		
			
				addressof (moved to the Boost.Core library)
				base_from_member
				BOOST_BINARY
				call_traits
				checked_delete (moved to the Boost.Core library)
				compressed_pair
				declval
				enable_if (moved to the Boost.Core library)
				in_place_factory
				iterator_adaptors
				generator iterator adaptors
				next/prior
				noncopyable (moved to the Boost.Core library)
				operators
				result_of
				throw_exception
				utility
            string_ref
            value_init
