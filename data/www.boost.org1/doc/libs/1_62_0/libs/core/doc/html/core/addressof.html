Header
      <boost/core/addressof.hpp>
        The header <boost/core/addressof.hpp>
        defines the function template boost::addressof.
        boost::addressof(x) returns
        the address of x. Ordinarily,
        this address can be obtained by &x, but the unary &
        operator can be overloaded. boost::addressof
        avoids calling used-defined operator&().
      
        boost::addressof was originally contributed by
        Brad King based on ideas from discussion with Doug Gregor.
      
Synopsis

    template<class T> T* addressof( T& x );

struct useless_type { };
class nonaddressable {
    useless_type operator&() const;

    nonaddressable x;
    nonaddressable* xp = boost::addressof(x);
    // nonaddressable* xpe =  /* error */
