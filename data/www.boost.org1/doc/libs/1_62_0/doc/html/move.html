Important
      To be able to use containers of movable-only values you will need to use containers
      supporting move semantics, like Boost.Container
      containers
    
Note

What is Boost.Move?
      Rvalue references are a major C++0x feature, enabling move semantics for C++
      values. However, we don't need C++0x compilers to take advantage of move semanatics.
      Boost.Move emulates C++0x move semantics in
      C++03 compilers and allows writing portable code that works optimally in C++03
      and C++0x compilers.
