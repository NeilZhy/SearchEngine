Introduction
      A Circular Buffer.
    
      Description
    
      The term circular
      buffer (also called a ring or cyclic
      buffer) refers to an area in memory which is used to store incoming
      data. When the buffer is filled, new data is written starting at the beginning
      of the buffer and overwriting the old.
    
      boost::circular_buffer
      is a STL compliant container.
    
      It is a kind of sequence similar to std::list
      or std::deque.
      It supports random access iterators, constant time insert and erase operations
      at the beginning or the end of the buffer and interoperability with std algorithms.
    
      The circular_buffer is
      especially designed to provide fixed capacity
      storage. When its capacity is exhausted, newly inserted elements will cause
      elements to be overwritten, either at the beginning or end of the buffer (depending
      on what insert operation is used).
    
      The circular_buffer only
      allocates memory when created, when the capacity is adjusted explicitly, or
      as necessary to accommodate resizing or assign operations.
    
      
    
      There is also a circular_buffer_space_optimized
      version available.
    
      
    
      circular_buffer_space_optimized
      is an adaptation of the circular_buffer
      which does not allocate memory all at once when created,
      instead it allocates memory as needed.
    
      The predictive memory allocation is similar to typical std::vector
      implementation. Memory is automatically freed as the size of the container
      decreases.
    
      The memory allocation process of the space-optimized circular buffer. The
      min_capacity
      of the capacity controller represents the minimal guaranteed amount of allocated
      memory. The allocated memory will never drop under this value. The default
      value of the min_capacity is
      set to 0. The min_capacity
      can be set using the constructor parameter ()
      capacity_control  or the function set_capacity.
    
      The space-optimized version is, of course, a little slower.
