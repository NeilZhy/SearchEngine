                Integer: The organization of boost integer headers and classes is designed to take advantage of <stdint.h> types from the 1999 C standard without resorting to undefined behavior in terms of the 1998 C++ standard. The header <boost/cstdint.hpp> makes the standard integer types safely available in namespace boost without placing any names in namespace std.                
                              
                Config: Helps Boost library developers adapt to compiler idiosyncrasies; not intended for library users.                
                              
                Rational: A rational number class.

                Conversion: Polymorphic casts.                
                              
                Pool: Memory pool management.                
                              
                Test: Support for simple program testing, full unit testing, and for program execution monitoring.                
                              
                Iterator: The Boost Iterator Library contains two parts. The first is a system of concepts which extend the C++ standard iterator requirements. The second is a framework of components for building iterators based on these extended concepts and includes several useful iterator adaptors.                
                              
                Compatibility: Help for non-conforming standard libraries.                
                              
                CRC: The Boost CRC Library provides two implementations of CRC (cyclic redundancy code) computation objects and two implementations of CRC computation functions. The implementations are template-based.                
                              
                Tokenizer: Break of a string or other character sequence into a series of tokens.

                Math: Boost.Math includes several contributions in the domain of mathematics: The Greatest Common Divisor and Least Common Multiple library provides run-time and compile-time evaluation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) or least common multiple (LCM) of two integers. The Special Functions library currently provides eight templated special functions, in namespace boost. The Complex Number Inverse Trigonometric Functions are the inverses of trigonometric functions currently present in the C++ standard. Quaternions are a relative of complex numbers often used to parameterise rotations in three dimentional space. Octonions, like quaternions, are a relative of complex numbers.                
                              
                Math Octonion: Octonions.

                Tuple: Ease definition of functions returning multiple values, and more.                
                              
                Bind: boost::bind is a generalization of the standard functions std::bind1st and std::bind2nd. It supports arbitrary function objects, functions, function pointers, and member function pointers, and is able to bind any argument to a specific value or route input arguments into arbitrary positions.                
                              
                Ref: A utility library for passing references to generic functions.

                Member Function: Generalized binders for function/object/pointers and member functions.                
                              
                Math Common Factor: Greatest common divisor and least common multiple.                
                              
                Preprocessor: Preprocessor metaprogramming tools including repetition and recursion.                
                              
                Assert: Customizable assert macros.                
                              
                IO State Savers: The I/O sub-library of Boost helps segregate the large number of Boost headers. This sub-library should contain various items to use with/for the standard I/O library.                
                              
                Lambda: Define small unnamed function objects at the actual call site, and more.

                uBLAS: uBLAS provides matrix and vector classes as well as basic linear algebra routines. Several dense, packed and sparse storage schemes are supported.                
                              
                Format: The format library provides a class for formatting arguments according to a format-string, as does printf, but with two major differences: format sends the arguments to an internal stream, and so is entirely type-safe and naturally supports all user-defined types; the ellipsis (...) can not be used correctly in the strongly typed context of format, and thus the function call with arbitrary arguments is replaced by successive calls to an argument feeding operator%.                
                              
                Multi-Array: Boost.MultiArray provides a generic N-dimensional array concept definition and common implementations of that interface.                
                              
                Date Time: A set of date-time libraries based on generic programming concepts.                
                              
                Dynamic Bitset: The dynamic_bitset class represents a set of bits. It provides accesses to the value of individual bits via an operator[] and provides all of the bitwise operators that one can apply to builtin integers, such as operator& and operator<<. The number of bits in the set is specified at runtime via a parameter to the constructor of the dynamic_bitset.                
                              
                Spirit: LL parser framework represents parsers directly as EBNF grammars in inlined C++.                
                              
                Optional: A value-semantic, type-safe wrapper for representing 'optional' (or 'nullable') objects of a given type. An optional object may or may not contain a value of the underlying type.                
                              
                MPL: The Boost.MPL library is a general-purpose, high-level C++ template metaprogramming framework of compile-time algorithms, sequences and metafunctions. It provides a conceptual foundation and an extensive set of powerful and coherent tools that make doing explict metaprogramming in C++ as easy and enjoyable as possible within the current language.                
                              
                Interval: Extends the usual arithmetic functions to mathematical intervals.                
                              
                Filesystem: The Boost Filesystem Library provides portable facilities to query and manipulate paths, files, and directories.                
                              
                Variant: Safe, generic, stack-based discriminated union container.                
                              
                Enable If: Selective inclusion of function template overloads.

                Range: A new infrastructure for generic algorithms that builds on top of the new iterator concepts.                
                              
                Program Options: The program_options library allows program developers to obtain program options, that is (name, value) pairs from the user, via conventional methods such as command line and config file.                
                              
                In Place Factory, Typed In Place Factory: Generic in-place construction of contained objects with a variadic argument-list.                
                              
                Parameter: Boost.Parameter Library - Write functions that accept arguments by name.                
                              
                Iostreams: Boost.IOStreams provides a framework for defining streams, stream buffers and i/o filters.                
                              
                Functional/Hash: A TR1 hash function object that can be extended to hash user defined types.                
                              
                Wave: The Boost.Wave library is a Standards conformant, and highly configurable implementation of the mandated C99/C++ preprocessor functionality packed behind an easy to use iterator interface.                
                              
                Pointer Container: Containers for storing heap-allocated polymorphic objects to ease OO-programming.                
                              
                TR1 (deprecated): The TR1 library provides an implementation of the C++ Technical Report on Standard Library Extensions. This library does not itself implement the TR1 components, rather it's a thin wrapper that will include your standard library's TR1 implementation (if it has one), otherwise it will include the Boost Library equivalents, and import them into namespace std::tr1.                
                              
                Foreach: In C++, writing a loop that iterates over a sequence is tedious. We can either use iterators, which requires a considerable amount of boiler-plate, or we can use the std::for_each() algorithm and move our loop body into a predicate, which requires no less boiler-plate and forces us to move our logic far from where it will be used. In contrast, some other languages, like Perl, provide a dedicated "foreach" construct that automates this process. BOOST_FOREACH is just such a construct for C++. It iterates over sequences for us, freeing us from having to deal directly with iterators or write predicates.                
                              
                Typeof: Typeof operator emulation.                
                              
                Xpressive: Regular expressions that can be written as strings or as expression templates, and which can refer to each other and themselves recursively with the power of context-free grammars.                
                              
                Statechart: Boost.Statechart - Arbitrarily complex finite state machines can be implemented in easily readable and maintainable C++ code.                
                              
                System: Operating system support, including the diagnostics support that will be part of the C++0x standard library.                
                              
                Math/Special Functions: A wide selection of mathematical special functions.
