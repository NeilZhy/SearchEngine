Rational Number library
The header rational.hpp provides an implementation of rational numbers.
The implementation is template-based, in a similar manner to the standard
complex number class.
This implementation is intended for general use. If you are a number
theorist, or otherwise have very stringent requirements, you would be advised
to use one of the more specialist packages available.
