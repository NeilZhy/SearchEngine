CRC Library
The header crc.hpp provides two implementations of CRC
(cyclic redundancy code) computation objects and two implementations of
CRC computation functions.  The implementations are template-based.
The first object implementation is for theoretical use.  It can
process single bits, but is considered slow for practical use.  The
second object implementation is byte-oriented and uses look-up
tables for fast operation.  The optimized implementation should
be suitable for general use.  The first function implementation uses the
optimized object.  The second function implementation allows the use of
a CRC that directly follows its data.
