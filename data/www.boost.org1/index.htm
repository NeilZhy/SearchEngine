                  Welcome to Boost.org!
                  Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source
                  libraries.
                  We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++
                  Standard Library. Boost libraries are intended to be widely
                  useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications.
                  The Boost license
                  encourages both commercial and non-commercial use.
                  We aim to establish "existing practice" and provide
                  reference implementations so that Boost libraries are
                  suitable for eventual standardization. Ten Boost libraries
                  are included in the C++ Standards Committee's Library Technical
                  Report (TR1) and in the new C++11 Standard.
                  C++11 also includes several more Boost libraries in
                  addition to those from TR1. More Boost libraries are
                  proposed for standardization in C++17.
                  Since 2006 an intimate week long annual conference
                  related to Boost called C++ Now has been held in Aspen, Colorado
                  each May. Boost has been a participant in the annual Google Summer of Code since
                  2007.
                  Getting Started
                  Boost works on
                  almost any modern operating system, including UNIX and
                  Windows variants. Follow the Getting
                  Started Guide to download and install Boost. Popular
                  Linux and Unix distributions such as Fedora,
                  Debian, and NetBSD include pre-built Boost
                  packages. Boost may also already be available on your
                  organization's internal web server.
                  If you want to
                  develop Boost, there's a getting
                  started guide on the wiki.
                  Background
                  Read on with the
                  introductory material to help you
                  understand what Boost is about and to help in educating
                  your organization about Boost.
                  Community
                  Boost welcomes and
                  thrives on participation from a variety of individuals and
                  organizations. Many avenues for participation are available
                  in the Boost
                  Community.
